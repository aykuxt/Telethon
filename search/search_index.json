Once you have Python installed, run: pip3 install -U telethon --user To install or upgrade the library to the latest version. Installing Development Versions \u00b6 If you want the latest unreleased changes, you can run the following command instead: pip3 install -U https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/archive/master.zip --user Note The development version may have bugs and is not recommended for production use. However, when you are reporting a library bug , you should try if the bug still occurs in this version. Verification \u00b6 To verify that the library is installed correctly, run the following command: python3 -c \"import telethon; print(telethon.__version__)\" The version number of the library should show in the output. Optional Dependencies \u00b6 If cryptg is installed, the library will work a lot faster , since encryption and decryption will be made in C instead of Python. If your code deals with a lot of updates or you are downloading/uploading a lot of files, you will notice a considerable speed-up (from a hundred kilobytes per second to several megabytes per second, if your connection allows it). If it's not installed, pyaes will be used (which is pure Python, so it's much slower). If pillow is installed, large images will be automatically resized when sending photos to prevent Telegram from failing with \"invalid image\". Official clients also do this. If aiohttp is installed, the library will be able to download WebDocument media files (otherwise you will get an error). If hachoir is installed, it will be used to extract metadata from files when sending documents. Telegram uses this information to show the song's performer, artist, title, duration, and for videos too (including size). Otherwise, they will default to empty values, and you can set the attributes manually. Note Some of the modules may require additional dependencies before being installed through pip . If you have an apt -based system, consider installing the most commonly missing dependencies: apt update apt install clang lib { jpeg-turbo,webp } -dev python { ,-dev } zlib-dev pip install -U --user setuptools pip install -U --user telethon cryptg pillow Thanks to @bb010g for writing down this nice list.","title":"Installation"},{"location":"basic/installation/#installation","text":"Telethon is a Python library, which means you need to download and install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/ if you haven't already.

Click under API Development tools. A Create new application window will appear. Fill in your application details. There is no need to enter any URL , and only the first two fields ( App title and Short name ) can currently be changed later. Click on Create application at the end. Remember that your API hash is secret and Telegram won't let you revoke it. Don't post it anywhere! Note This API ID and hash is the one used by your application , not your phone number. You can use this API ID and hash with any phone number or even for bot accounts. Editing the Code \u00b6 This is a little introduction for those new to Python programming in general. We will write our code inside hello.py , so you can use any text editor that you like. To run the code, use python3 hello.py from the terminal. Important Don't call your script telethon.py ! Python will try to import the client from there and it will fail with an error such as ImportError: cannot import name 'TelegramClient' ... . Signing In \u00b6 We can finally write some code to log into our account! from telethon import TelegramClient # Use your own values from my.telegram.org api_id = 12345 api_hash = '0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef' # The first parameter is the .session file name (absolute paths allowed) with TelegramClient ( 'anon' , api_id , api_hash ) as client : client . loop . run_until_complete ( client . send_message ( 'me' , 'Hello, myself!' )) In the first line, we import the class name so we can create an instance of the client. Then, we define variables to store our API ID and hash conveniently. At last, we create a new TelegramClient <telethon.client.telegramclient.TelegramClient> instance and call it client . We can now use the client variable for anything that we want, such as sending a message to ourselves. Note Since Telethon is an asynchronous library, you need to await coroutine functions to have them run (or otherwise, run the loop until they are complete). In this tiny example, we don't bother making an async def main() . See :ref: mastering-asyncio to find out more. Using a with block is the preferred way to use the library. It will automatically start() <telethon.client.auth.AuthMethods.start> the client, logging or signing up if necessary. If the .session file already existed, it will not login again, so be aware of this if you move or rename the file! Signing In as a Bot Account \u00b6 You can also use Telethon for your bots (normal bot accounts, not users). You will still need an API ID and hash, but the process is very similar: from telethon.sync import TelegramClient api_id = 12345 api_hash = '0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef' bot_token = '12345:0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef' # We have to manually call \"start\" if we want an explicit bot token bot = TelegramClient ( 'bot' , api_id , api_hash ) . start ( bot_token = bot_token ) # But then we can use the client instance as usual with bot : ... To get a bot account, you need to talk with @BotFather <https://t.me/BotFather> _. Signing In behind a Proxy \u00b6 If you need to use a proxy to access Telegram, you will need to install PySocks and then change: TelegramClient ( 'anon' , api_id , api_hash ) with TelegramClient ( 'anon' , api_id , api_hash , proxy = ( socks . SOCKS5 , '127.0.0.1' , 4444 )) (of course, replacing the IP and port with the IP and port of the proxy). The proxy= argument should be a tuple, a list or a dict, consisting of parameters described in PySocks usage . Using MTProto Proxies \u00b6 MTProto Proxies are Telegram's alternative to normal proxies, and work a bit differently. The following protocols are available: ConnectionTcpMTProxyAbridged ConnectionTcpMTProxyIntermediate ConnectionTcpMTProxyRandomizedIntermediate (preferred) For now, you need to manually specify these special connection modes if you want to use a MTProto Proxy. Your code would look like this: from telethon import TelegramClient , connection # we need to change the connection ^^^^^^^^^^ client = TelegramClient ( 'anon' , api_id , api_hash , # Use one of the available connection modes. # Normally, this one works with most proxies. connection = connection . ConnectionTcpMTProxyRandomizedIntermediate , # Then, pass the proxy details as a tuple: # (host name, port, proxy secret) # # If the proxy has no secret, the secret must be: # '00000000000000000000000000000000' proxy = ( 'mtproxy.example.com' , 2002 , 'secret' ) ) In future updates, we may make it easier to use MTProto Proxies (such as avoiding the need to manually pass connection= ).

After all, you want to be notified when a new message arrives, when a member joins, when someone starts typing, etc. For that, you can use events . Important It is strongly advised to enable logging when working with events, since exceptions in event handlers are hidden by default. Please add the following snippet to the very top of your file: import logging logging . basicConfig ( format = '[ %(levelname) 5s / %(asctime)s ] %(name)s : %(message)s ' , level = logging . WARNING ) Getting Started \u00b6 Let's start things with an example to automate replies: from telethon import TelegramClient , events client = TelegramClient ( 'anon' , api_id , api_hash ) @client . on ( events . NewMessage ) async def my_event_handler ( event ): if 'hello' in event . raw_text : await event . reply ( 'hi!' ) client . start () client . run_until_disconnected () This code isn't much, but there might be some things unclear. Let's break it down: from telethon import TelegramClient , events client = TelegramClient ( 'anon' , api_id , api_hash ) This is normal creation (of course, pass session name, API ID and hash). Nothing we don't know already. @client . on ( events . NewMessage ) This Python decorator will attach itself to the my_event_handler definition, and basically means that on a NewMessage <telethon.events.newmessage.NewMessage> event , the callback function you're about to define will be called: async def my_event_handler ( event ): if 'hello' in event . raw_text : await event . reply ( 'hi!' ) If a NewMessage <telethon.events.newmessage.NewMessage> event occurs, and 'hello' is in the text of the message, we reply() <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.reply> to the event with a 'hi!' message. Note Event handlers must be async def . After all, Telethon is an asynchronous library based on asyncio , which is a safer and often faster approach to threads. You must await all method calls that use network requests, which is most of them. More Examples \u00b6 Replying to messages with hello is fun, but, can we do more? @client . on ( events . NewMessage ( outgoing = True , pattern = r '\\.save' )) async def handler ( event ): if event . is_reply : replied = await event . get_reply_message () sender = replied . sender await client . download_profile_photo ( sender ) await event . respond ( 'Saved your photo {} ' . format ( sender . username )) We could also get replies. This event filters outgoing messages (only those that we send will trigger the method), then we filter by the regex r'\\.save' , which will match messages starting with \".save\" . Inside the method, we check whether the event is replying to another message or not. If it is, we get the reply message and the sender of that message, and download their profile photo. Let's delete messages which contain \"heck\". We don't allow swearing here. @client . on ( events . NewMessage ( pattern = r '(?i).*heck' )) async def handler ( event ): await event . delete () With the r'(?i).*heck' regex, we match case-insensitive \"heck\" anywhere in the message. Regex is very powerful and you can learn more at https://regexone.com/ . So far, we have only seen the NewMessage <telethon.events.newmessage.NewMessage> , but there are many more which will be covered later. This is only a small introduction to updates. Entities \u00b6 When you need the user or chat where an event occurred, you must use the following methods: async def handler ( event ): # Good chat = await event . get_chat () sender = await event . get_sender () chat_id = event . chat_id sender_id = event . sender_id # BAD. Don't do this chat = event . chat sender = event . sender chat_id = event . chat . id sender_id = event . sender . id Events are like messages, but don't have all the information a message has! When you manually get a message, it will have all the information it needs. When you receive an update about a message, it won't have all the information, so you have to use the methods , not the properties. Make sure you understand the code seen here before continuing! As a rule of thumb, remember that new message events behave just like message objects, so you can do with them everything you can do with a message object.","title":"Updates"},{"location":"basic/updates/#updates","text":"Updates are an important topic in a messaging platform like Telegram.

WARNING )","title":"Updates"},{"location":"basic/updates/#getting-started","text":"Let's start things with an example to automate replies: from telethon import TelegramClient , events client = TelegramClient ( 'anon' , api_id , api_hash ) @client . on ( events . NewMessage ) async def my_event_handler ( event ): if 'hello' in event . raw_text : await event . reply ( 'hi!' ) client . start () client . run_until_disconnected () This code isn't much, but there might be some things unclear. Let's break it down: from telethon import TelegramClient , events client = TelegramClient ( 'anon' , api_id , api_hash ) This is normal creation (of course, pass session name, API ID and hash). Nothing we don't know already. @client . on ( events . NewMessage ) This Python decorator will attach itself to the my_event_handler definition, and basically means that on a NewMessage <telethon.events.newmessage.NewMessage> event , the callback function you're about to define will be called: async def my_event_handler ( event ): if 'hello' in event . raw_text : await event . reply ( 'hi!' ) If a NewMessage <telethon.events.newmessage.NewMessage> event occurs, and 'hello' is in the text of the message, we reply() <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.reply> to the event with a 'hi!' message. Note Event handlers must be async def . After all, Telethon is an asynchronous library based on asyncio , which is a safer and often faster approach to threads. You must await all method calls that use network requests, which is most of them.","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"basic/updates/#more-examples","text":"Replying to messages with hello is fun, but, can we do more? @client . on ( events .

This event filters outgoing messages (only those that we send will trigger the method), then we filter by the regex r'\\.save' , which will match messages starting with \".save\" . Inside the method, we check whether the event is replying to another message or not. If it is, we get the reply message and the sender of that message, and download their profile photo. Let's delete messages which contain \"heck\". We don't allow swearing here. @client . on ( events . NewMessage ( pattern = r '(?i).*heck' )) async def handler ( event ): await event . delete () With the r'(?i).*heck' regex, we match case-insensitive \"heck\" anywhere in the message. Regex is very powerful and you can learn more at https://regexone.com/ .

Don't do this chat = event . chat sender = event . sender chat_id = event . chat . id sender_id = event . sender . id Events are like messages, but don't have all the information a message has! When you manually get a message, it will have all the information it needs. When you receive an update about a message, it won't have all the information, so you have to use the methods , not the properties. Make sure you understand the code seen here before continuing! As a rule of thumb, remember that new message events behave just like message objects, so you can do with them everything you can do with a message object.","title":"Entities"},{"location":"concepts/entities/","text":"Entities \u00b6 The library widely uses the concept of \"entities\". An entity will refer to any :tl: User , :tl: Chat or :tl: Channel object that the API may return in response to certain methods, such as :tl: GetUsersRequest . Note When something \"entity-like\" is required, it means that you need to provide something that can be turned into an entity. These things include, but are not limited to, usernames, exact titles, IDs, :tl: Peer objects, or even entire :tl: User , :tl: Chat and :tl: Channel objects and even phone numbers from people you have in your contact list . To \"encounter\" an ID, you would have to \"find it\" like you would in the normal app. If the peer is in your dialogs, you would need to client.get_dialogs() <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.get_dialogs> . If the peer is someone in a group, you would similarly client.get_participants(group) <telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.get_participants> . Once you have encountered an ID, the library will (by default) have saved their access_hash for you, which is needed to invoke most methods. This is why sometimes you might encounter this error when working with the library. You should except ValueError and run code that you know should work to find the entity. What is an Entity? \u00b6 A lot of methods and requests require entities to work. For example, you send a message to an entity , get the username of an entity , and so on. There are a lot of things that work as entities: usernames, phone numbers, chat links, invite links, IDs, and the types themselves. That is, you can use any of those when you see an \"entity\" is needed. Note Remember that the phone number must be in your contact list before you can use it. You should use, from better to worse : Input entities. For example, event.input_chat <telethon.tl.custom.chatgetter.ChatGetter.input_chat> , message.input_sender <telethon.tl.custom.sendergetter.SenderGetter.input_sender> , or caching an entity you will use a lot with entity = await client.get_input_entity(...) . Entities. For example, if you had to get someone's username, you can just use user or channel . It will work. Only use this option if you already have the entity! IDs. This will always look the entity up from the cache (the *.session file caches seen entities). Usernames, phone numbers and links. The cache will be used too (unless you force a client.get_entity() <telethon.client.users.UserMethods.get_entity> ), but may make a request if the username, phone or link has not been found yet. In recent versions of the library, the following two are equivalent: async def handler ( event ): await client . send_message ( event . sender_id , 'Hi' ) await client . send_message ( event . input_sender , 'Hi' ) If you need to be 99% sure that the code will work (sometimes it's simply impossible for the library to find the input entity), or if you will reuse the chat a lot, consider using the following instead: async def handler ( event ): # This method may make a network request to find the input sender. # Properties can't make network requests, so we need a method. sender = await event . get_input_sender () await client . send_message ( sender , 'Hi' ) await client . send_message ( sender , 'Hi' ) Getting Entities \u00b6 Through the use of the :ref: sessions , the library will automatically remember the ID and hash pair, along with some extra information, so you're able to just do this: # (These examples assume you are inside an \"async def\") # # Dialogs are the \"conversations you have open\". # This method returns a list of Dialog, which # has the .entity attribute and other information. # # This part is IMPORTANT, because it fills the entity cache. dialogs = await client . get_dialogs () # All of these work and do the same. username = await client . get_entity ( 'username' ) username = await client . get_entity ( 't.me/username' ) username = await client . get_entity ( 'https://telegram.dog/username' ) # Other kind of entities. channel = await client . get_entity ( 'telegram.me/joinchat/AAAAAEkk2WdoDrB4-Q8-gg' ) contact = await client . get_entity ( '+34xxxxxxxxx' ) friend = await client . get_entity ( friend_id ) # Getting entities through their ID (User, Chat or Channel) entity = await client . get_entity ( some_id ) # You can be more explicit about the type for said ID by wrapping # it inside a Peer instance. This is recommended but not necessary. from telethon.tl.types import PeerUser , PeerChat , PeerChannel my_user = await client . get_entity ( PeerUser ( some_id )) my_chat = await client . get_entity ( PeerChat ( some_id )) my_channel = await client . get_entity ( PeerChannel ( some_id )) Note You don't need to get the entity before using it! Just let the library do its job. Use a phone from your contacts, username, ID or input entity (preferred but not necessary), whatever you already have. All methods in the :ref: telethon-client call .get_input_entity() <telethon.client.users.UserMethods.get_input_entity> prior to sending the request to save you from the hassle of doing so manually. That way, convenience calls such as client.send_message('username', 'hi!') <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.send_message> become possible. Every entity the library encounters (in any response to any call) will by default be cached in the .session file (an SQLite database), to avoid performing unnecessary API calls. If the entity cannot be found, additonal calls like :tl: ResolveUsernameRequest or :tl: GetContactsRequest may be made to obtain the required information. Entities vs. Input Entities \u00b6 Note This section is informative, but worth reading. The library will transparently handle all of these details for you. On top of the normal types, the API also make use of what they call their Input* versions of objects. The input version of an entity (e.g. :tl: InputPeerUser , :tl: InputChat , etc.) only contains the minimum information that's required from Telegram to be able to identify who you're referring to: a :tl: Peer 's ID and hash . They are named like this because they are input parameters in the requests. Entities' ID are the same for all user and bot accounts, however, the access hash is different for each account , so trying to reuse the access hash from one account in another will not work. Sometimes, Telegram only needs to indicate the type of the entity along with their ID. For this purpose, :tl: Peer versions of the entities also exist, which just have the ID. You cannot get the hash out of them since you should not be needing it. The library probably has cached it before. Peers are enough to identify an entity, but they are not enough to make a request with them. You need to know their hash before you can \"use them\", and to know the hash you need to \"encounter\" them, let it be in your dialogs, participants, message forwards, etc. Note You can use peers with the library. Behind the scenes, they are replaced with the input variant. Peers \"aren't enough\" on their own but the library will do some more work to use the right type. As we just mentioned, API calls don't need to know the whole information about the entities, only their ID and hash. For this reason, another method, client.get_input_entity() <telethon.client.users.UserMethods.get_input_entity> is available. This will always use the cache while possible, making zero API calls most of the time. When a request is made, if you provided the full entity, e.g. an :tl: User , the library will convert it to the required :tl: InputPeer automatically for you. You should always favour client.get_input_entity() <telethon.client.users.UserMethods.get_input_entity> over client.get_entity() <telethon.client.users.UserMethods.get_entity> for this reason! Calling the latter will always make an API call to get the most recent information about said entity, but invoking requests don't need this information, just the :tl: InputPeer . Only use client.get_entity() <telethon.client.users.UserMethods.get_entity> if you need to get actual information, like the username, name, title, etc. of the entity. To further simplify the workflow, since the version 0.16.2 of the library, the raw requests you make to the API are also able to call client.get_input_entity() <telethon.client.users.UserMethods.get_input_entity> wherever needed, so you can even do things like: await client ( SendMessageRequest ( 'username' , 'hello' )) The library will call the .resolve() method of the request, which will resolve 'username' with the appropriated :tl: InputPeer . Don't worry if you don't get this yet, but remember some of the details here are important. Full Entities \u00b6 In addition to :tl: PeerUser , :tl: InputPeerUser , :tl: User (and its variants for chats and channels), there is also the concept of :tl: UserFull . This full variant has additional information such as whether the user is blocked, its notification settings, the bio or about of the user, etc. There is also :tl: messages.ChatFull which is the equivalent of full entities for chats and channels, with also the about section of the channel. Note that the users field only contains bots for the channel (so that clients can suggest commands to use). You can get both of these by invoking :tl: GetFullUser , :tl: GetFullChat and :tl: GetFullChannel respectively. Accessing Entities \u00b6 Although it's explicitly noted in the documentation that messages subclass ChatGetter <telethon.tl.custom.chatgetter.ChatGetter> and SenderGetter <telethon.tl.custom.sendergetter.SenderGetter> , some people still don't get inheritance. When the documentation says \"Bases: telethon.tl.custom.chatgetter.ChatGetter \" it means that the class you're looking at, also can act as the class it bases. In this case, ChatGetter <telethon.tl.custom.chatgetter.ChatGetter> knows how to get the chat where a thing belongs to. So, a Message <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message> is a ChatGetter <telethon.tl.custom.chatgetter.ChatGetter> . That means you can do this: message . is_private message . chat_id await message . get_chat () # ...etc SenderGetter <telethon.tl.custom.sendergetter.SenderGetter> is similar: message . user_id await message . get_input_user () message . user # ...etc Quite a few things implement them, so it makes sense to reuse the code. For example, all events (except raw updates) implement ChatGetter <telethon.tl.custom.chatgetter.ChatGetter> since all events occur in some chat. Summary \u00b6 TL;DR; If you're here because of \"Could not find the input entity for\" , you must ask yourself \"how did I find this entity through official applications\"? Now do the same with the library. Use what applies: # (These examples assume you are inside an \"async def\") async with client : # Does it have an username? Use it! entity = await client . get_entity ( username ) # Do you have a conversation open with them? Get dialogs. await client . get_dialogs () # Are they participant of some group? Get them. await client . get_participants ( 'TelethonChat' ) # Is the entity the original sender of a forwarded message? Get it. await client . get_messages ( 'TelethonChat' , 100 ) # NOW you can use the ID, anywhere! await client . send_message ( 123456 , 'Hi!' ) entity = await client . get_entity ( 123456 ) print ( entity ) Once the library has \"seen\" the entity, you can use their integer ID. You can't use entities from IDs the library hasn't seen. You must make the library see them at least once and disconnect properly. You know where the entities are and you must tell the library.

Yes! print ( entity . stringify ()) Will show a much better: Channel ( id = 1066197625 , title = 'Telegram Usernames' , photo = ChatPhotoEmpty ( ), date = datetime . datetime ( 2016 , 12 , 16 , 15 , 15 , 43 , tzinfo = datetime . timezone . utc ), version = 0 , creator = False , left = True , broadcast = True , verified = True , megagroup = False , restricted = False , signatures = False , min = False , scam = False , has_link = False , has_geo = False , slowmode_enabled = False , access_hash =- 6309373984955162244 , username = 'username' , restriction_reason = [ ], admin_rights = None , banned_rights = None , default_banned_rights = None , participants_count = None ) Now it's easy to see how we could get, for example, the year value. It's inside date : channel_year = entity . date . year You don't need to print everything to see what all the possible values can be. You can just search in http://tl.telethon.dev . Remember that you can use Python's isinstance to check the type of something. For example: from telethon import types if isinstance ( entity . photo , types . ChatPhotoEmpty ): print ( 'Channel has no photo' )","title":"String-based Debugging"},{"location":"misc/changelog/","text":"Changelog (Version History) \u00b6 This page lists all the available versions of the library, in chronological order. You should read this when upgrading the library to know where your code can break, and where it can take advantage of new goodies! Minor quality of life improvements (v1.14) \u00b6 Published at 2020/05/26 Scheme layer used: 113 Some nice things that were missing, along with the usual bug-fixes. Additions \u00b6 New Message.dice <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.dice> property. The func= parameter of events can now be an async function. Bug fixes \u00b6 Fixed client.action() <telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.action> having an alias wrong. Fixed incorrect formatting of some errors. Probably more reliable detection of pin events in small groups. Fixed send methods on client.conversation() <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.conversation> were not honoring cancellation. Flood waits of zero seconds are handled better. Getting the pinned message in a chat was failing. Fixed the return value when forwarding messages if some were missing and also the return value of albums. Enhancements \u00b6 .tgs files are now recognised as animated stickers. The service message produced by Message.pin() <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.pin> is now returned. Sending a file with client.send_file() <telethon.client.uploads.UploadMethods.send_file> now works fine when you pass an existing dice media (e.g. sending a message copy). client.edit_permissions() <telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.edit_permissions> now has the embed_links parameter which was missing. Bug Fixes (v1.13) \u00b6 Published at 2020/04/25 Scheme layer used: 112 Bug fixes and layer bump. Bug fixes \u00b6 Passing None as the entity to client.delete_messages() <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.delete_messages> would fail. When downloading a thumbnail, the name inferred was wrong. Bug Fixes (v1.12) \u00b6 Published at 2020/04/20 Scheme layer used: 111 Once again nothing major, but a few bug fixes and primarily the new layer deserves a new minor release. Bug fixes \u00b6 These were already included in the v1.11.3 patch: libssl check was failing on macOS. Getting input users would sometimes fail on events.ChatAction <telethon.events.chataction.ChatAction> . These bug fixes are available in this release and beyond: Avoid another occurrence of MemoryError . Sending large files in albums would fail because it tried to cache them. The thumb was being ignored when sending files from :tl: InputFile . Fixed editing inline messages from callback queries in some cases. Proxy connection is now blocking which should help avoid some errors. Bug Fixes (v1.11) \u00b6 Published at 2020/02/20 +------------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 110 | +------------------------+ It has been a while since the last release, and a few bug fixes have been made since then. This release includes them and updates the scheme layer. Note that most of the bug-fixes are available in the v1.10.10 patch. Bug fixes * Fix ``MemoryError`` when casting certain media. * Fix `client.get_entity() <telethon.client.users.UserMethods.get_entity>` on small group chats. * `client.delete_dialog() <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.delete_dialog>` now handles deactivated chats more gracefully. * Sending a message with ``file=`` would ignore some of the parameters. * Errors are now un-pickle-able once again. * Fixed some issues regarding markdown and HTML (un)parsing. The following are also present in ``v1.10.10``: * Fixed some issues with `events.Album <telethon.events.album.Album>`. * Fixed some issues with `client.kick_participant() <telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.kick_participant>` and `client.edit_admin() <telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.edit_admin>`. * Fixed sending albums and more within `client.conversation() <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.conversation>`. * Fixed some import issues. * And a lot more minor stuff. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ * Videos can now be included when sending albums. * Getting updates after reconnect should be more reliable. * Updated documentation and added more examples. * More security checks during the generation of the authorization key. The following are also present in ``v1.10.10``: * URLs like ``t.me/@username`` are now valid. * Auto-sleep now works for slow-mode too. * Improved some error messages. * Some internal improvements and updating. * `client.pin_message() <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.pin_message>` now also works with message objects. * Asynchronous file descriptors are now allowed during download and upload. Scheduled Messages (v1.10) ========================== *Published at 2019/09/08* +------------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 105 | +------------------------+ You can now schedule messages to be sent (or edited, or forwarded\u2026) at a later time, which can also work as reminders for yourself when used in your own chat! .. code-block:: python from datetime import timedelta # Remind yourself to walk the dog in 10 minutes (after you play with Telethon's update) await client.send_message('me', 'Walk the dog', schedule=timedelta(minutes=10)) # Remind your friend tomorrow to update Telethon await client.send_message(friend, 'Update Telethon!', schedule=timedelta(days=1)) Additions New Button.auth <telethon.tl.custom.button.Button.auth> friendly button you can use to ask users to login to your bot. Telethon's repository now contains *.nix expressions that you can use. New client.kick_participant() <telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.kick_participant> method to truly kick (not ban) participants. New schedule parameter in client.send_message() <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.send_message> , client.edit_message() <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.edit_message> , client.forward_messages() <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.forward_messages> and client.send_file() <telethon.client.uploads.UploadMethods.send_file> . Bug fixes * Fix calling ``flush`` on file objects which lack this attribute. * Fix `CallbackQuery <telethon.events.callbackquery.CallbackQuery>` pattern. * Fix `client.action() <telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.action>` not returning itself when used in a context manager (so the ``as`` would be `None`). * Fix sending :tl:`InputKeyboardButtonUrlAuth` as inline buttons. * Fix `client.edit_permissions() <telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.edit_permissions>` defaults. * Fix `Forward <telethon.tl.custom.forward.Forward>` had its ``client`` as `None`. * Fix (de)serialization of negative timestamps (caused by the information in some sites with instant view, where the date could be very old). * Fix HTML un-parsing. * Fix ``to/from_id`` in private messages when using multiple clients. * Stop disconnecting from `None` (incorrect logging). * Fix double-read on double-connect. * Fix `client.get_messages() <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.get_messages>` when being passed more than 100 IDs. * Fix `Message.document <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.document>` for documents coming from web-pages. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ * Some documentation improvements, including the TL reference. * Documentation now avoids ``telethon.sync``, which should hopefully be less confusing. * Better error messages for flood wait. * You can now `client.get_drafts() <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.get_drafts>` for a single entity (which means you can now get a single draft from a single chat). * New-style file IDs now work with Telethon. * The ``progress_callback`` for `client.upload_file() <telethon.client.uploads.UploadMethods.upload_file>` can now be an ``async def``. Animated Stickers (v1.9) ======================== *Published at 2019/07/06* +------------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 103 | +------------------------+ With the layer 103, Telethon is now able to send and receive animated stickers! These use the ``'application/x-tgsticker'`` mime-type and for now, you can access its raw data, which is a gzipped JSON. Additions New events.Album <telethon.events.album.Album> to easily receive entire albums! New client.edit_admin() <telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.edit_admin> and client.edit_permissions() <telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.edit_permissions> methods to more easily manage your groups. New pattern= in CallbackQuery <telethon.events.callbackquery.CallbackQuery> . New conversation.cancel_all() <telethon.tl.custom.conversation.Conversation.cancel> method, to cancel all currently-active conversations in a particular chat. New telethon.utils.encode_waveform and telethon.utils.decode_waveform methods as implemented by Telegram Desktop, which lets you customize how voice notes will render. New ignore_pinned parameter in client.iter_dialogs() <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.iter_dialogs> . New Message.mark_read() <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.mark_read> method. You can now use strike-through in markdown with ~~text~~ , and the corresponding HTML tags for strike-through, quotes and underlined text. You can now nest entities, as in **__text__** . Bug fixes * Fixed downloading contacts. * Fixed `client.iter_dialogs() <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.iter_dialogs>` missing some under certain circumstances. * Fixed incredibly slow imports under some systems due to expensive path resolution when searching for ``libssl``. * Fixed captions when sending albums. * Fixed invalid states in `Conversation <telethon.tl.custom.conversation.Conversation>`. * Fixes to some methods in utils regarding extensions. * Fixed memory cycle in `Forward <telethon.tl.custom.forward.Forward>` which let you do things like the following: .. code-block:: python original_fwd = message.forward.original_fwd.original_fwd.original_fwd.original_fwd.original_fwd.original_fwd Hopefully you didn't rely on that in your code. * Fixed `File.ext <telethon.tl.custom.file.File.ext>` not working on unknown mime-types, despite the file name having the extension. * Fixed ``ids=..., reverse=True`` in `client.iter_messages() <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.iter_messages>`. * Fixed `Draft <telethon.tl.custom.draft.Draft>` not being aware of the entity. * Added missing re-exports in ``telethon.sync``. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ * Improved `conversation.cancel() <telethon.tl.custom.conversation.Conversation.cancel>` behaviour. Now you can use it from anywhere. * The ``progress_callback`` in `client.download_media() <telethon.client.downloads.DownloadMethods.download_media>` now lets you use ``async def``. * Improved documentation and the online method reference at https://tl.telethon.dev. Documentation Overhaul (v1.8) ============================= *Published at 2019/05/30* +------------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 100 | +------------------------+ The documentation has been completely reworked from the ground up, with awesome new quick references such as :ref:`client-ref` to help you quickly find what you need! Raw methods also warn you when a friendly variant is available, so that you don't accidentally make your life harder than it has to be. In addition, all methods in the client now are fully annotated with type hints! More work needs to be done, but this should already help a lot when using Telethon from any IDEs. You may have noticed that the patch versions between ``v1.7.2`` to ``v1.7.7`` have not been documented. This is because patch versions should only contain bug fixes, no new features or breaking changes. This hasn't been the case in the past, but from now on, the library will try to adhere more strictly to the `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org>`_ principles. If you ever want to look at those bug fixes, please use the appropriated ``git`` command, such as ``git shortlog v1.7.1...v1.7.4``, but in general, they probably just fixed your issue. With that out of the way, let's look at the full change set: Breaking Changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ * The layer changed, so take note if you use the raw API, as it's usual. * The way photos are downloaded changed during the layer update of the previous version, and fixing that bug as a breaking change in itself. `client.download_media() <telethon.client.downloads.DownloadMethods.download_media>` now offers a different way to deal with thumbnails. Additions New Message.file <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.file> property! Now you can trivially access message.file.id <telethon.tl.custom.file.File.id> to get the file ID of some media, or even print(message.file.name) . Archiving dialogs with Dialog.archive() <telethon.tl.custom.dialog.Dialog.archive> or client.edit_folder() <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.edit_folder> is now possible. New cleaned-up method to stream downloads with client.iter_download() <telethon.client.downloads.DownloadMethods.iter_download> , which offers a lot of flexibility, such as arbitrary offsets for efficient seeking. Dialog.delete() <telethon.tl.custom.dialog.Dialog.delete> has existed for a while, and now client.delete_dialog() <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.delete_dialog> exists too so you can easily leave chats or delete dialogs without fetching all dialogs. Some people or chats have a lot of profile photos. You can now iterate over all of them with the new client.iter_profile_photos() <telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.iter_profile_photos> method. You can now annoy everyone with the new Message.pin(notify=True) <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.pin> ! The client has its own variant too, called client.pin_message() <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.pin_message> . Bug fixes * Correctly catch and raise all RPC errors. * Downloading stripped photos wouldn't work correctly. * Under some systems, ``libssl`` would fail to load earlier than expected, causing the library to fail when being imported. * `conv.get_response() <telethon.tl.custom.conversation.Conversation.get_response>` after ID 0 wasn't allowed when it should. * `InlineBuilder <telethon.tl.custom.inlinebuilder.InlineBuilder>` only worked with local files, but files from anywhere are supported. * Accessing the text property from a raw-API call to fetch :tl:`Message` would fail (any any other property that needed the client). * Database is now upgraded if the version was lower, not different. From now on, this should help with upgrades and downgrades slightly. * Fixed saving ``pts`` and session-related stuff. * Disconnection should not raise any errors. * Invite links of the form ``tg://join?invite=`` now work. * `client.iter_participants(search=...) <telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.iter_participants>` now works on private chats again. * Iterating over messages in reverse with a date as offset wouldn't work. * The conversation would behave weirdly when a timeout occurred. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ * ``telethon`` now re-export all the goodies that you commonly need when using the library, so e.g. ``from telethon import Button`` will now work. * ``telethon.sync`` now re-exports everything from ``telethon``, so that you can trivially import from just one place everything that you need. * More attempts at reducing CPU usage after automatically fetching missing entities on events. This isn't a big deal, even if it sounds like one. * Hexadecimal invite links are now supported. You didn't need them, but they will now work. Internal Changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ * Deterministic code generation. This is good for ``diff``. * On Python 3.7 and above, we properly close the connection. * A lot of micro-optimization. * Fixes to bugs introduced while making this release. * Custom commands on ``setup.py`` are nicer to use. Fix-up for Photo Downloads (v1.7.1) =================================== *Published at 2019/04/24* Telegram changed the way thumbnails (which includes photos) are downloaded, so you can no longer use a :tl:`PhotoSize` alone to download a particular thumbnail size (this is a **breaking change**). Instead, you will have to specify the new ``thumb`` parameter in `client.download_media() <telethon.client.downloads.DownloadMethods.download_media>` to download a particular thumbnail size. This addition enables you to easily download thumbnails from documents, something you couldn't do easily before. Easier Events (v1.7) ==================== *Published at 2019/04/22* +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 98 | +-----------------------+ If you have been using Telethon for a while, you probably know how annoying the \"Could not find the input entity for\u2026\" error can be. In this new version, the library will try harder to find the input entity for you! That is, instead of doing: .. code-block:: python @client.on(events.NewMessage) async def handler(event): await client.download_profile_photo(await event.get_input_sender()) # ...... needs await, it's a method ^^^^^ ^^ You can now do: .. code-block:: python @client.on(events.NewMessage) async def handler(event): await client.download_profile_photo(event.input_sender) # ...... no await, it's a property! ^ # It's also 12 characters shorter :) And even the following will hopefully work: .. code-block:: python @client.on(events.NewMessage) async def handler(event): await client.download_profile_photo(event.sender_id) A lot of people use IDs thinking this is the right way of doing it. Ideally, you would always use ``input_*``, not ``sender`` or ``sender_id`` (and the same applies to chats). But, with this change, IDs will work just the same as ``input_*`` inside events. **This feature still needs some more testing**, so please do open an issue if you find strange behaviour. Breaking Changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ * The layer changed, and a lot of things did too. If you are using raw API, you should be careful with this. In addition, some attributes weren't of type ``datetime`` when they should be, which has been fixed. * Due to the layer change, you can no longer download photos with just their :tl:`PhotoSize`. Version 1.7.1 introduces a new way to download thumbnails to work around this issue. * `client.disconnect() <telethon.client.telegrambaseclient.TelegramBaseClient.disconnect>` is now asynchronous again. This means you need to ``await`` it. You don't need to worry about this if you were using ``with client`` or `client.run_until_disconnected <telethon.client.updates.UpdateMethods.run_until_disconnected>`. This should prevent the \"pending task was destroyed\" errors. Additions New in-memory cache for input entities. This should mean a lot less of disk look-ups. New client.action <telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.action> method to easily indicate that you are doing some chat action: .. code-block:: python async with client.action(chat, 'typing'): await asyncio.sleep(2) # type for 2 seconds await client.send_message(chat, 'Hello world! I type slow ^^') You can also easily use this for sending files, playing games, etc. New bugs ~~~~~~~~ Downloading photos is broken. This is fixed in v1.7.1. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ Fix sending photos from streams/bytes. Fix unhandled error when sending requests that were too big. Fix edits that arrive too early on conversations. Fix client.edit_message() <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.edit_message> when trying to edit a file. Fix method calls on the objects returned by client.iter_dialogs() <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.iter_dialogs> . Attempt at fixing client.iter_dialogs() <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.iter_dialogs> missing many dialogs. offset_date in client.iter_messages() <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.iter_messages> was being ignored in some cases. This has been worked around. Fix callback_query.edit() <telethon.events.callbackquery.CallbackQuery.Event.edit> . Fix CallbackQuery(func=...) <telethon.events.callbackquery.CallbackQuery> was being ignored. Fix UserUpdate <telethon.events.userupdate.UserUpdate> not working for \"typing\" (and uploading file, etc.) status. Fix library was not expecting IOError from PySocks. Fix library was raising a generic ConnectionError and not the one that actually occurred. Fix the blacklist_chats parameter in MessageRead <telethon.events.messageread.MessageRead> not working as intended. Fix client.download_media(contact) <telethon.client.downloads.DownloadMethods.download_media> . Fix mime type when sending mp3 files. Fix forcibly getting the sender or chat from events would not always return all their information. Fix sending albums with client.send_file() <telethon.client.uploads.UploadMethods.send_file> was not returning the sent messages. Fix forwarding albums with client.forward_messages() <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.forward_messages> . Some fixes regarding filtering updates from chats. Attempt at preventing duplicated updates. Prevent double auto-reconnect. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Some improvements related to proxy connections. Several updates and improvements to the documentation, such as optional dependencies now being properly listed. You can now forward messages from different chats directly with client.forward_messages <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.forward_messages> . Tidying up Internals (v1.6) \u00b6 Published at 2019/02/27 +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 95 | +-----------------------+ First things first, sorry for updating the layer in the previous patch version. That should only be done between major versions ideally, but due to how Telegram works, it's done between minor versions. However raw API has and will always be considered \"unsafe\", this meaning that you should always use the convenience client methods instead. These methods don't cover the full API yet, so pull requests are welcome. Breaking Changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The layer update, of course. This didn't really need a mention here. You can no longer pass a batch_size when iterating over messages. No other method exposed this parameter, and it was only meant for testing purposes. Instead, it's now a private constant. client.iter_* methods no longer have a _total parameter which was supposed to be private anyway. Instead, they return a new generator object which has a .total attribute: .. code-block:: python it = client.iter_messages(chat) for i, message in enumerate(it, start=1): percentage = i / it.total print('{:.2%} {}'.format(percentage, message.text)) Additions ~~~~~~~~~ You can now pass phone and phone_code_hash in client.sign_up <telethon.client.auth.AuthMethods.sign_up> , although you probably don't need that. Thanks to the overhaul of all client.iter_* methods, you can now do: .. code-block:: python for message in reversed(client.iter_messages('me')): print(message.text) Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ Fix telethon.utils.resolve_bot_file_id , which wasn't working after the layer update (so you couldn't send some files by bot file IDs). Fix sending albums as bot file IDs (due to image detection improvements). Fix takeout() <telethon.client.account.AccountMethods.takeout> failing when they need to download media from other DCs. Fix repeatedly calling conversation.get_response() <telethon.tl.custom.conversation.Conversation.get_response> when many messages arrived at once (i.e. when several of them were forwarded). Fixed connecting with ConnectionTcpObfuscated <telethon.network.connection.tcpobfuscated.ConnectionTcpObfuscated> . Fix client.get_peer_id('me') <telethon.client.users.UserMethods.get_peer_id> . Fix warning of \"missing sqlite3\" when in reality it just had wrong tables. Fix a strange error when using too many IDs in client.delete_messages() <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.delete_messages> . Fix client.send_file <telethon.client.uploads.UploadMethods.send_file> with the result of client.upload_file <telethon.client.uploads.UploadMethods.upload_file> . When answering inline results, their order was not being preserved. Fix events.ChatAction <telethon.events.chataction.ChatAction> detecting user leaves as if they were kicked. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Cleared up some parts of the documentation. Improved some auto-casts to make life easier. Improved image detection. Now you can easily send bytes and streams of images as photos, unless you force document. Sending images as photos that are too large will now be resized before uploading, reducing the time it takes to upload them and also avoiding errors when the image was too large (as long as pillow is installed). The images will remain unchanged if you send it as a document. Treat errors.RpcMcgetFailError as a temporary server error to automatically retry shortly. This works around most issues. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ New common way to deal with retries ( retry_range ). Cleaned up the takeout client. Completely overhauled asynchronous generators. Layer Update (v1.5.5) \u00b6 Published at 2019/01/14 +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 93 | +-----------------------+ There isn't an entry for v1.5.4 because it contained only one hot-fix regarding loggers. This update is slightly bigger so it deserves mention. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ New supports_streaming parameter in client.send_file <telethon.client.uploads.UploadMethods.send_file> . Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ Dealing with mimetypes should cause less issues in systems like Windows. Potentially fix alternative session storages that had issues with dates. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Saner timeout defaults for conversations. Path -like files are now supported for thumbnails. Added new hot-keys to the online documentation at https://tl.telethon.dev/ such as / to search. Press ? to view them all. Bug Fixes (v1.5.3) \u00b6 Published at 2019/01/14 Several bug fixes and some quality of life enhancements. Breaking Changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ message.edit <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.edit> now respects the previous message buttons or link preview being hidden. If you want to toggle them you need to explicitly set them. This is generally the desired behaviour, but may cause some bots to have buttons when they shouldn't. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ You can now \"hide_via\" when clicking on results from client.inline_query <telethon.client.bots.BotMethods.inline_query> to @bing and @gif . You can now further configure the logger Telethon uses to suit your needs. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ Fixes for ReadTheDocs to correctly build the documentation. Fix :tl: UserEmpty not being expected when getting the input variant. The message object returned when sending a message with buttons wouldn't always contain the :tl: ReplyMarkup . Setting email when configuring 2FA wasn't properly supported. utils.resolve_bot_file_id now works again for photos. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Chat and channel participants can now be used as peers. Reworked README and examples at https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/tree/master/telethon_examples Takeout Sessions (v1.5.2) \u00b6 Published at 2019/01/05 You can now easily start takeout sessions (also known as data export sessions) through client.takeout() <telethon.client.account.AccountMethods.takeout> . Some of the requests will have lower flood limits when done through the takeout session. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ The new AdminLogEvent <telethon.tl.custom.adminlogevent.AdminLogEvent> had a bug that made it unusable. client.iter_dialogs() <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.iter_dialogs> will now locally check for the offset date, since Telegram ignores it. Answering inline queries with media no works properly. You can now use the library to create inline bots and send stickers through them! object.to_json() (v1.5.1) \u00b6 Published at 2019/01/03 The library already had a way to easily convert the objects the API returned into dictionaries through object.to_dict() , but some of the fields are dates or bytes which JSON can't serialize directly. For convenience, a new object.to_json() has been added which will by default format both of those problematic types into something sensible. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ New client.iter_admin_log() <telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.iter_admin_log> method. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ client.is_connected() <telethon.client.telegrambaseclient.TelegramBaseClient.is_connected> would be wrong when the initial connection failed. Fixed UnicodeDecodeError when accessing the text of messages with malformed offsets in their entities. Fixed client.get_input_entity() <telethon.client.users.UserMethods.get_input_entity> for integer IDs that the client has not seen before. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ You can now configure the reply markup when using Button <telethon.tl.custom.button.Button> as a bot. More properties for Message <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message> to make accessing media convenient. Downloading to file=bytes will now return a bytes object with the downloaded media. Polls with the Latest Layer (v1.5) \u00b6 Published at 2018/12/25 +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 91 | +-----------------------+ This version doesn't really bring many new features, but rather focuses on updating the code base to support the latest available Telegram layer, 91. This layer brings polls, and you can create and manage them through Telethon! Breaking Changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The layer change from 82 to 91 changed a lot of things in the raw API, so be aware that if you rely on raw API calls, you may need to update your code, in particular if you work with files . They have a new file_reference parameter that you must provide. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ New client.is_bot() <telethon.client.users.UserMethods.is_bot> method. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ Markdown and HTML parsing now behave correctly with leading whitespace. HTTP connection should now work correctly again. Using caption=None would raise an error instead of setting no caption. KeyError is now handled properly when forwarding messages. button.click() <telethon.tl.custom.messagebutton.MessageButton.click> now works as expected for :tl: KeyboardButtonGame . Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Some improvements to the search in the full API and generated examples. Using entities with access_hash = 0 will now work in more cases. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Some changes to the documentation and code generation. 2FA code was updated to work under the latest layer. Error Descriptions in CSV files (v1.4.3) \u00b6 Published at 2018/12/04 While this may seem like a minor thing, it's a big usability improvement. Anyone who wants to update the documentation for known errors, or whether some methods can be used as a bot, user or both, can now be easily edited. Everyone is encouraged to help document this better! Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ TimeoutError was not handled during automatic reconnects. Getting messages by ID using :tl: InputMessageReplyTo could fail. Fixed message.get_reply_message <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.get_reply_message> as a bot when a user replied to a different bot. Accessing some document properties in a Message <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message> would fail. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Accessing events.ChatAction <telethon.events.chataction.ChatAction> properties such as input users may now work in more cases. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Error descriptions and information about methods is now loaded from a CSV file instead of being part of several messy JSON files. Bug Fixes (v1.4.2) \u00b6 Published at 2018/11/24 This version also includes the v1.4.1 hot-fix, which was a single quick fix and didn't really deserve an entry in the changelog. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ Authorization key wouldn't be saved correctly, requiring re-login. Conversations with custom events failed to be cancelled. Fixed telethon.sync when using other threads. Fix markdown/HTML parser from failing with leading/trailing whitespace. Fix accessing chat_action_event.input_user property. Potentially improved handling unexpected disconnections. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Better default behaviour for client.send_read_acknowledge <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.send_read_acknowledge> . Clarified some points in the documentation. Clearer errors for utils.get_peer* . Connection Overhaul (v1.4) \u00b6 Published at 2018/11/03 Yet again, a lot of work has been put into reworking the low level connection classes. This means asyncio.open_connection is now used correctly and the errors it can produce are handled properly. The separation between packing, encrypting and network is now abstracted away properly, so reasoning about the code is easier, making it more maintainable. As a user, you shouldn't worry about this, other than being aware that quite a few changes were made in the insides of the library and you should report any issues that you encounter with this version if any. Breaking Changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The threaded version of the library will no longer be maintained, primarily because it never was properly maintained anyway. If you have old code, stick with old versions of the library, such as 0.19.1.6 . Timeouts no longer accept timedelta . Simply use seconds. The callback parameter from telethon.tl.custom.button.Button.inline() was removed, since it had always been a bad idea. Adding the callback there meant a lot of extra work for every message sent, and only registering it after the first message was sent! Instead, use telethon.events.callbackquery.CallbackQuery . Additions ~~~~~~~~~ New dialog.delete() <telethon.tl.custom.dialog.Dialog.delete> method. New conversation.cancel() <telethon.tl.custom.conversation.Conversation.cancel> method. New retry_delay delay for the client to be used on auto-reconnection. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ Fixed Conversation.wait_event() <telethon.tl.custom.conversation.Conversation.wait_event> . Fixed replying with photos/documents on inline results. client.is_user_authorized() <telethon.client.users.UserMethods.is_user_authorized> now works correctly after client.log_out() <telethon.client.auth.AuthMethods.log_out> . dialog.is_group <telethon.tl.custom.dialog.Dialog> now works for :tl: ChatForbidden . Not using async with when needed is now a proper error. events.CallbackQuery <telethon.events.callbackquery.CallbackQuery> with string regex was not working properly. client.get_entity('me') <telethon.client.users.UserMethods.get_entity> now works again. Empty codes when signing in are no longer valid. Fixed file cache for in-memory sessions. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Support next_offset in inline_query.answer() <telethon.events.inlinequery.InlineQuery.Event.answer> . Support <a href=\"tg://user?id=123\"> mentions in HTML parse mode. New auto-casts for :tl: InputDocument and :tl: InputChatPhoto . Conversations are now exclusive per-chat by default. The request that caused a RPC error is now shown in the error message. New full API examples in the generated documentation. Fixed some broken links in the documentation. client.disconnect() <telethon.client.telegrambaseclient.TelegramBaseClient.disconnect> is now synchronous, but you can still await it for consistency or compatibility. Event Templates (v1.3) \u00b6 Published at 2018/09/22 If you have worked with Flask templates, you will love this update, since it gives you the same features but even more conveniently: .. code-block:: python # handlers/welcome.py from telethon import events @events.register(events.NewMessage('(?i)hello')) async def handler(event): client = event.client await event.respond('Hi!') await client.send_message('me', 'Sent hello to someone') This will register <telethon.events.register> the handler callback to handle new message events. Note that you didn't add this to any client yet, and this is the key point: you don't need a client to define handlers! You can add it later: .. code-block:: python # main.py from telethon import TelegramClient import handlers.welcome with TelegramClient(...) as client: # This line adds the handler we defined before for new messages client.add_event_handler(handlers.welcome.handler) client.run_until_disconnected() This should help you to split your big code base into a more modular design. Breaking Changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ .sender is the .chat when the message is sent in a broadcast channel. This makes sense, because the sender of the message was the channel itself, but you now must take into consideration that it may be either a :tl: User or :tl: Channel instead of being None . Additions ~~~~~~~~~ New MultiError class when invoking many requests at once through client([requests]) . New custom func= on all events. These will receive the entire event, and a good usage example is func=lambda e: e.is_private . New .web_preview field on messages. The .photo and .document will also return the media in the web preview if any, for convenience. Callback queries now have a .chat in most circumstances. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ Running code with python3 -O would remove critical code from asserts. Fix some rare ghost disconnections after reconnecting. Fix strange behavior for send_message(chat, Message, reply_to=foo) <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.send_message> . The loop= argument was being pretty much ignored. Fix MemorySession file caching. The logic for getting entities from their username is now correct. Fixes for sending stickers from .webp files in Windows, again. Fix disconnection without being logged in. Retrieving media from messages would fail. Getting some messages by ID on private chats. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ iter_participants <telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.iter_participants> will now use its search= as a symbol set when aggressive=True , so you can do client.get_participants(group, aggressive=True, search='\u0430\u0431\u0432\u0433\u0434\u0435\u0451\u0436\u0437\u0438\u0439\u043a\u043b\u043c\u043d\u043e\u043f\u0440\u0441\u0442') . The StringSession supports custom encoding. Callbacks for telethon.client.auth.AuthMethods.start can be async . Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Cherry-picked a commit to use asyncio.open_connection in the lowest level of the library. Do open issues if this causes trouble, but it should otherwise improve performance and reliability. Building and resolving events overhaul. Conversations, String Sessions and More (v1.2) \u00b6 Published at 2018/08/14 This is a big release! Quite a few things have been added to the library, such as the new Conversation <telethon.tl.custom.conversation.Conversation> . This makes it trivial to get tokens from @BotFather <https://t.me/BotFather> _: .. code-block:: python from telethon.tl import types with client.conversation('BotFather') as conv: conv.send_message('/mybots') message = conv.get_response() message.click(0) message = conv.get_edit() message.click(0) message = conv.get_edit() for _, token in message.get_entities_text(types.MessageEntityCode): print(token) In addition to that, you can now easily load and export session files without creating any on-disk file thanks to the StringSession : .. code-block:: python from telethon.sessions import StringSession string = StringSession.save(client.session) Check out :ref: sessions for more details. For those who aren't able to install cryptg , the support for libssl has been added back. While interfacing libssl is not as fast, the speed when downloading and sending files should really be noticeably faster. While those are the biggest things, there are still more things to be excited about. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ The mentioned method to start a new client.conversation <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.conversation> . Implemented global search through client.iter_messages <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.iter_messages> with None entity. New client.inline_query <telethon.client.bots.BotMethods.inline_query> method to perform inline queries. Bot-API-style file_id can now be used to send files and download media. You can also access telethon.utils.resolve_bot_file_id and telethon.utils.pack_bot_file_id to resolve and create these file IDs yourself. Note that each user has its own ID for each file so you can't use a bot's file_id with your user, except stickers. New telethon.utils.get_peer , useful when you expect a :tl: Peer . Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ UTC timezone for telethon.events.userupdate.UserUpdate . Bug with certain input parameters when iterating messages. RPC errors without parent requests caused a crash, and better logging. incoming = outgoing = True was not working properly. Getting a message's ID was not working. File attributes not being inferred for open() 'ed files. Use MemorySession if sqlite3 is not installed by default. Self-user would not be saved to the session file after signing in. client.catch_up() <telethon.client.updates.UpdateMethods.catch_up> seems to be functional again. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Updated documentation. Invite links will now use cache, so using them as entities is cheaper. You can reuse message buttons to send new messages with those buttons. .to_dict() will now work even on invalid TLObject 's. Better Custom Message (v1.1.1) \u00b6 Published at 2018/07/23 The custom.Message <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message> class has been rewritten in a cleaner way and overall feels less hacky in the library. This should perform better than the previous way in which it was patched. The release is primarily intended to test this big change, but also fixes Python 3.5.2 compatibility which was broken due to a trailing comma. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ Using functools.partial on event handlers broke updates if they had uncaught exceptions. A bug under some session files where the sender would export authorization for the same data center, which is unsupported. Some logical bugs in the custom message class. Bot Friendly (v1.1) \u00b6 Published at 2018/07/21 Two new event handlers to ease creating normal bots with the library, namely events.InlineQuery <telethon.events.inlinequery.InlineQuery> and events.CallbackQuery <telethon.events.callbackquery.CallbackQuery> for handling @InlineBot queries or reacting to a button click. For this second option, there is an even better way: .. code-block:: python from telethon.tl.custom import Button async def callback(event): await event.edit('Thank you!') bot.send_message(chat, 'Hello!', buttons=Button.inline('Click me', callback)) You can directly pass the callback when creating the button. This is fine for small bots but it will add the callback every time you send a message, so you probably should do this instead once you are done testing: .. code-block:: python markup = bot.build_reply_markup(Button.inline('Click me', callback)) bot.send_message(chat, 'Hello!', buttons=markup) And yes, you can create more complex button layouts with lists: .. code-block:: python from telethon import events global phone = '' @bot.on(events.CallbackQuery) async def handler(event): global phone if event.data == b'<': phone = phone[:-1] else: phone += event.data.decode('utf-8') await event.answer('Phone is now {}'.format(phone)) markup = bot.build_reply_markup([ [Button.inline('1'), Button.inline('2'), Button.inline('3')], [Button.inline('4'), Button.inline('5'), Button.inline('6')], [Button.inline('7'), Button.inline('8'), Button.inline('9')], [Button.inline('+'), Button.inline('0'), Button.inline('<')], ]) bot.send_message(chat, 'Enter a phone', buttons=markup) (Yes, there are better ways to do this). Now for the rest of things: Additions ~~~~~~~~~ New custom.Button <telethon.tl.custom.button.Button> class to help you create inline (or normal) reply keyboards. You must sign in as a bot to use the buttons= parameters. New events usable if you sign in as a bot: events.InlineQuery <telethon.events.inlinequery.InlineQuery> and events.CallbackQuery <telethon.events.callbackquery.CallbackQuery> . New silent parameter when sending messages, usable in broadcast channels. Documentation now has an entire section dedicate to how to use the client's friendly methods at (removed broken link) . Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ Empty except are no longer used which means sending a keyboard interrupt should now work properly. The pts of incoming updates could be None . UTC timezone information is properly set for read datetime . Some infinite recursion bugs in the custom message class. :tl: Updates was being dispatched to raw handlers when it shouldn't. Using proxies and HTTPS connection mode may now work properly. Less flood waits when downloading media from different data centers, and the library will now detect them even before sending requests. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Interactive sign in now supports signing in with a bot token. timedelta is now supported where a date is expected, which means you can e.g. ban someone for timedelta(minutes=5) . Events are only built once and reused many times, which should save quite a few CPU cycles if you have a lot of the same type. You can now click inline buttons directly if you know their data. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ When downloading media, the right sender is directly used without previously triggering migrate errors. Code reusing for getting the chat and the sender, which easily enables this feature for new types. New HTTP(S) Connection Mode (v1.0.4) \u00b6 Published at 2018/07/09 This release implements the HTTP connection mode to the library, which means certain proxies that only allow HTTP connections should now work properly. You can use it doing the following, like any other mode: .. code-block:: python from telethon import TelegramClient, sync from telethon.network import ConnectionHttp client = TelegramClient(..., connection=ConnectionHttp) with client: client.send_message('me', 'Hi!') Additions ~~~~~~~~~ add_mark= is now back on utils.get_input_peer and also on client.get_input_entity() <telethon.client.users.UserMethods.get_input_entity> . New client.get_peer_id <telethon.client.users.UserMethods.get_peer_id> convenience for utils.get_peer_id(await client.get_input_entity(peer)) . Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ If several TLMessage in a MessageContainer exceeds 1MB, it will no longer be automatically turned into one. This basically means that e.g. uploading 10 file parts at once will work properly again. Documentation fixes and some missing await . Revert named argument for client.forward_messages <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.forward_messages> Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ New auto-casts to :tl: InputNotifyPeer and chat_id . Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Outgoing TLMessage are now pre-packed so if there's an error when serializing the raw requests, the library will no longer swallow it. This also means re-sending packets doesn't need to re-pack their bytes. Iterate Messages in Reverse (v1.0.3) \u00b6 Published at 2018/07/04 +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 82 | +-----------------------+ Mostly bug fixes, but now there is a new parameter on client.iter_messages <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.iter_messages> to support reversing the order in which messages are returned. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ The mentioned reverse parameter when iterating over messages. A new sequential_updates parameter when creating the client for updates to be processed sequentially. This is useful when you need to make sure that all updates are processed in order, such as a script that only forwards incoming messages somewhere else. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ Count was always None for message.button_count <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.button_count> . Some fixes when disconnecting upon dropping the client. Support for Python 3.4 in the sync version, and fix media download. Some issues with events when accessing the input chat or their media. Hachoir wouldn't automatically close the file after reading its metadata. Signing in required a named code= parameter, but usage without a name was really widespread so it has been reverted. Bug Fixes (v1.0.2) \u00b6 Published at 2018/06/28 Updated some asserts and parallel downloads, as well as some fixes for sync. Bug Fixes (v1.0.1) \u00b6 Published at 2018/06/27 And as usual, every major release has a few bugs that make the library unusable! This quick update should fix those, namely: Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ client.start() <telethon.client.auth.AuthMethods.start> was completely broken due to a last-time change requiring named arguments everywhere. Since the rewrite, if your system clock was wrong, the connection would get stuck in an infinite \"bad message\" loop of responses from Telegram. Accessing the buttons of a custom message wouldn't work in channels, which lead to fix a completely different bug regarding starting bots. Disconnecting could complain if the magic telethon.sync was imported. Successful automatic reconnections now ask Telegram to send updates to us once again as soon as the library is ready to listen for them. Synchronous magic (v1.0) \u00b6 Published at 2018/06/27 .. important:: If you come from Telethon pre-1.0 you **really** want to read :ref:`compatibility-and-convenience` to port your scripts to the new version. The library has been around for well over a year. A lot of improvements have been made, a lot of user complaints have been fixed, and a lot of user desires have been implemented. It's time to consider the public API as stable, and remove some of the old methods that were around until now for compatibility reasons. But there's one more surprise! There is a new magic telethon.sync module to let you use all the methods in the :ref: TelegramClient <telethon-client> (and the types returned from its functions) in a synchronous way, while using asyncio behind the scenes! This means you're now able to do both of the following: .. code-block:: python import asyncio async def main(): await client.send_message('me', 'Hello!') asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main()) # ...can be rewritten as: from telethon import sync client.send_message('me', 'Hello!') Both ways can coexist (you need to await if the loop is running). You can also use the magic sync module in your own classes, and call sync.syncify(cls) to convert all their async def into magic variants. Breaking Changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ message.get_fwd_sender is now in message.forward <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.forward> . client.idle is now client.run_until_disconnected() <telethon.client.updates.UpdateMethods.run_until_disconnected> client.add_update_handler is now client.add_event_handler <telethon.client.updates.UpdateMethods.add_event_handler> client.remove_update_handler is now client.remove_event_handler <telethon.client.updates.UpdateMethods.remove_event_handler> client.list_update_handlers is now client.list_event_handlers <telethon.client.updates.UpdateMethods.list_event_handlers> client.get_message_history is now client.get_messages <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.get_messages> client.send_voice_note is now client.send_file <telethon.client.uploads.UploadMethods.send_file> with is_voice=True . client.invoke() is now client(...) . report_errors has been removed since it's currently not used, and flood_sleep_threshold is now part of the client. The update_workers and spawn_read_thread arguments are gone. Simply remove them from your code when you create the client. Methods with a lot of arguments can no longer be used without specifying their argument. Instead you need to use named arguments. This improves readability and not needing to learn the order of the arguments, which can also change. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ client.send_file <telethon.client.uploads.UploadMethods.send_file> now accepts external http:// and https:// URLs. You can use the :ref: TelegramClient <telethon-client> inside of with blocks, which will client.start() <telethon.client.auth.AuthMethods.start> and disconnect() <telethon.client.telegrambaseclient.TelegramBaseClient.disconnect> the client for you: .. code-block:: python from telethon import TelegramClient, sync with TelegramClient(name, api_id, api_hash) as client: client.send_message('me', 'Hello!') Convenience at its maximum! You can even chain the .start() <telethon.client.auth.AuthMethods.start> method since it returns the instance of the client: .. code-block:: python with TelegramClient(name, api_id, api_hash).start(bot_token=token) as bot: bot.send_message(chat, 'Hello!') Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ There were some @property async def left, and some await property . \"User joined\" event was being treated as \"User was invited\". SQLite's cursor should not be closed properly after usage. await the updates task upon disconnection. Some bug in Python 3.5.2's asyncio causing 100% CPU load if you forgot to call client.disconnect() <telethon.client.telegrambaseclient.TelegramBaseClient.disconnect> . The method is called for you on object destruction, but you still should disconnect manually or use a with block. Some fixes regarding disconnecting on client deletion and properly saving the authorization key. Passing a class to message.get_entities_text <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.get_entities_text> now works properly. Iterating messages from a specific user in private messages now works. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Both client.start() <telethon.client.auth.AuthMethods.start> and client.run_until_disconnected() <telethon.client.updates.UpdateMethods.run_until_disconnected> can be ran in both a synchronous way (without starting the loop manually) or from an async def where they need to have an await . Core Rewrite in asyncio (v1.0-rc1) \u00b6 Published at 2018/06/24 +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 81 | +-----------------------+ This version is a major overhaul of the library internals. The core has been rewritten, cleaned up and refactored to fix some oddities that have been growing inside the library. This means that the code is easier to understand and reason about, including the code flow such as conditions, exceptions, where to reconnect, how the library should behave, and separating different retry types such as disconnections or call fails, but it also means that some things will necessarily break in this version. All requests that touch the network are now methods and need to have their await (or be ran until their completion). Also, the library finally has the simple logo it deserved: a carefully hand-written .svg file representing a T following Python's colours. Breaking Changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ If you relied on internals like the MtProtoSender and the TelegramBareClient , both are gone. They are now MTProtoSender <telethon.network.mtprotosender.MTProtoSender> and TelegramBaseClient <telethon.client.telegrambaseclient.TelegramBaseClient> and they behave differently. Underscores have been renamed from filenames. This means telethon.errors.rpc_error_list won't work, but you should have been using telethon.errors all this time instead. client.connect <telethon.client.telegrambaseclient.TelegramBaseClient.connect> no longer returns True on success. Instead, you should except the possible ConnectionError and act accordingly. This makes it easier to not ignore the error. You can no longer set retries=n when calling a request manually. The limit works differently now, and it's done on a per-client basis. Accessing .sender <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.sender> , .chat <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.chat> and similar may not work in events anymore, since previously they could access the network. The new rule is that properties are not allowed to make API calls. You should use .get_sender() <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.get_sender> , .get_chat() <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.get_chat> instead while using events. You can safely access properties if you get messages through client.get_messages() <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.get_messages> or other methods in the client. The above point means reply_message is now .get_reply_message() <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.get_reply_message> , and fwd_from_entity is now get_fwd_sender() <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.get_fwd_sender> . Also forward was gone in the previous version, and you should be using fwd_from instead. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ Telegram's Terms Of Service are now accepted when creating a new account. This can possibly help avoid bans. This has no effect for accounts that were created before. The method reference <https://tl.telethon.dev/> _ now shows which methods can be used if you sign in with a bot_token . There's a new client.disconnected <telethon.client.telegrambaseclient.TelegramBaseClient.disconnected> future which you can wait on. When a disconnection occurs, you will now, instead letting it happen in the background. More configurable retries parameters, such as auto-reconnection, retries when connecting, and retries when sending a request. You can filter events.NewMessage <telethon.events.newmessage.NewMessage> by sender ID, and also whether they are forwards or not. New ignore_migrated parameter for client.iter_dialogs <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.iter_dialogs> . Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ Several fixes to telethon.events.newmessage.NewMessage . Removed named length argument in to_bytes for PyPy. Raw events failed due to not having ._set_client . message.get_entities_text <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.get_entities_text> properly supports filtering, even if there are no message entities. message.click <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.click> works better. The server started sending :tl: DraftMessageEmpty which the library didn't handle correctly when getting dialogs. The \"correct\" chat is now always returned from returned messages. to_id was not validated when retrieving messages by their IDs. '__' is no longer considered valid in usernames. The fd is removed from the reader upon closing the socket. This should be noticeable in Windows. :tl: MessageEmpty is now handled when searching messages. Fixed a rare infinite loop bug in client.iter_dialogs <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.iter_dialogs> for some people. Fixed TypeError when there is no .sender <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.sender> . Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ You can now delete over 100 messages at once with client.delete_messages <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.delete_messages> . Signing in now accounts for AuthRestartError itself, and also handles PasswordHashInvalidError . __all__ is now defined, so from telethon import * imports sane defaults (client, events and utils). This is however discouraged and should be used only in quick scripts. pathlib.Path is now supported for downloading and uploading media. Messages you send to yourself are now considered outgoing, unless they are forwarded. The documentation has been updated with a brand new asyncio crash course to encourage you use it. You can still use the threaded version if you want though. .name property is now properly supported when sending and downloading files. Custom parse_mode , which can now be set per-client, support :tl: MessageEntityMentionName so you can return those now. The session file is saved less often, which could result in a noticeable speed-up when working with a lot of incoming updates. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The flow for sending a request is as follows: the TelegramClient creates a MTProtoSender with a Connection , and the sender starts send and receive loops. Sending a request means enqueueing it in the sender, which will eventually pack and encrypt it with its ConnectionState instead of using the entire Session instance. When the data is packed, it will be sent over the Connection and ultimately over the TcpClient . Reconnection occurs at the MTProtoSender level, and receiving responses follows a similar process, but now asyncio.Future is used for the results which are no longer part of all TLObject , instead are part of the TLMessage which simplifies things. Objects can no longer be content_related and instead subclass TLRequest , making the separation of concerns easier. The TelegramClient has been split into several mixin classes to avoid having a 3,000-lines-long file with all the methods. More special cases in the MTProtoSender have been cleaned up, and also some attributes from the Session which didn't really belong there since they weren't being saved. The telethon_generator/ can now convert .tl files into .json , mostly as a proof of concept, but it might be useful for other people. Custom Message class (v0.19.1) \u00b6 Published at 2018/06/03 +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 80 | +-----------------------+ This update brings a new telethon.tl.custom.message.Message object! All the methods in the telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient that used to return a :tl: Message will now return this object instead, which means you can do things like the following: .. code-block:: python msg = client.send_message(chat, 'Hello!') msg.edit('Hello there!') msg.reply('Good day!') print(msg.sender) Refer to its documentation to see all you can do, again, click telethon.tl.custom.message.Message to go to its page. Breaking Changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The telethon.network.connection.common.Connection class is now an ABC, and the old ConnectionMode is now gone. Use a specific connection (like telethon.network.connection.tcpabridged.ConnectionTcpAbridged ) instead. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ You can get messages by their ID with telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.get_messages 's ids parameter: .. code-block:: python message = client.get_messages(chats, ids=123) # Single message message_list = client.get_messages(chats, ids=[777, 778]) # Multiple More convenience properties for telethon.tl.custom.dialog.Dialog . New default telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.parse_mode . You can edit the media of messages that already have some media. New dark theme in the online tl reference, check it out at https://tl.telethon.dev/ . Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ Some IDs start with 1000 and these would be wrongly treated as channels. Some short usernames like @vote were being ignored. telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.iter_messages 's from_user was failing if no filter had been set. telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.iter_messages 's min_id/max_id was being ignored by Telegram. This is now worked around. telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.catch_up would fail with empty states. telethon.events.newmessage.NewMessage supports incoming=False to indicate outgoing=True . Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ You can now send multiple requests at once while preserving the order: .. code-block:: python from telethon.tl.functions.messages import SendMessageRequest client([SendMessageRequest(chat, 'Hello 1!'), SendMessageRequest(chat, 'Hello 2!')], ordered=True) Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ without rowid is not used in SQLite anymore. Unboxed serialization would fail. Different default limit for iter_messages and get_messages . Some clean-up in the telethon_generator/ package. Catching up on Updates (v0.19) \u00b6 Published at 2018/05/07 +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 76 | +-----------------------+ This update prepares the library for catching up with updates with the new telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.catch_up method. This feature needs more testing, but for now it will let you \"catch up\" on some old updates that occurred while the library was offline, and brings some new features and bug fixes. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ Add search , filter and from_user parameters to telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.iter_messages . telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.download_file now supports a None path to return the file in memory and return its bytes . Events now have a .original_update field. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ Fixed a race condition when receiving items from the network. A disconnection is made when \"retries reached 0\". This hasn't been tested but it might fix the bug. reply_to would not override :tl: Message object's reply value. Add missing caption when sending :tl: Message with media. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Retry automatically on RpcCallFailError . This error happened a lot when iterating over many messages, and retrying often fixes it. Faster telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.iter_messages by sleeping only as much as needed. telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.edit_message now supports omitting the entity if you pass a :tl: Message . telethon.events.raw.Raw can now be filtered by type. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The library now distinguishes between MTProto and API schemas. :tl: State is now persisted to the session file. Connection won't retry forever. Fixed some errors and cleaned up the generation of code. Fixed typos and enhanced some documentation in general. Add auto-cast for :tl: InputMessage and :tl: InputLocation . Pickle-able objects (v0.18.3) \u00b6 Published at 2018/04/15 Now you can use Python's pickle module to serialize RPCError and any other TLObject thanks to @vegeta1k95 ! A fix that was fairly simple, but still might be useful for many people. As a side note, the documentation at https://tl.telethon.dev now lists known RPCError for all requests, so you know what to expect. This required a major rewrite, but it was well worth it! Breaking changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.forward_messages now returns a single item instead of a list if the input was also a single item. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ New telethon.events.messageread.MessageRead event, to find out when and who read which messages as soon as it happens. Now you can access .chat_id on all events and .sender_id on some. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ Possibly fix some bug regarding lost GzipPacked requests. The library now uses the \"real\" layer 75, hopefully. Fixed .entities name collision on updates by making it private. AUTH_KEY_DUPLICATED is handled automatically on connection. Markdown parser's offset uses match.start() to allow custom regex. Some filter types (as a type) were not supported by telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.iter_participants . telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.remove_event_handler works. telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.start works on all terminals. :tl: InputPeerSelf case was missing from telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.get_input_entity . Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ The parse_mode for messages now accepts a callable. telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.download_media accepts web previews. telethon.tl.custom.dialog.Dialog instances can now be casted into :tl: InputPeer . Better logging when reading packages \"breaks\". Better and more powerful setup.py gen command. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The library won't call .get_dialogs() on entity not found. Instead, it will raise ValueError() so you can properly except it. Several new examples and updated documentation. py:obj is the default Sphinx's role which simplifies .rst files. setup.py now makes use of python_requires . Events now live in separate files. Other minor changes. Several bug fixes (v0.18.2) \u00b6 Published at 2018/03/27 Just a few bug fixes before they become too many. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ Getting an entity by its positive ID should be enough, regardless of their type (whether it's an User , a Chat or a Channel ). Although wrapping them inside a Peer is still recommended, it's not necessary. New client.edit_2fa function to change your Two Factor Authentication settings. .stringify() and string representation for custom Dialog/Draft . Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ Some bug regarding .get_input_peer . events.ChatAction wasn't picking up all the pins. force_document=True was being ignored for albums. Now you're able to send Photo and Document as files. Wrong access to a member on chat forbidden error for .get_participants . An empty list is returned instead. me/self check for .get[_input]_entity has been moved up so if someone has \"me\" or \"self\" as their name they won't be retrieved. Iterator methods (v0.18.1) \u00b6 Published at 2018/03/17 All the .get_ methods in the TelegramClient now have a .iter_ counterpart, so you can do operations while retrieving items from them. For instance, you can client.iter_dialogs() and break once you find what you're looking for instead fetching them all at once. Another big thing, you can get entities by just their positive ID. This may cause some collisions (although it's very unlikely), and you can (should) still be explicit about the type you want. However, it's a lot more convenient and less confusing. Breaking changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The library only offers the default SQLiteSession again. See :ref: sessions for more on how to use a different storage from now on. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ Events now override __str__ and implement .stringify() , just like every other TLObject does. events.ChatAction now has :meth: respond , :meth: reply and :meth: delete for the message that triggered it. :meth: client.iter_participants (and its :meth: client.get_participants counterpart) now expose the filter argument, and the returned users also expose the .participant they are. You can now use :meth: client.remove_event_handler and :meth: client.list_event_handlers similar how you could with normal updates. New properties on events.NewMessage , like .video_note and .gif to access only specific types of documents. The Draft class now exposes .text and .raw_text , as well as a new :meth: Draft.send to send it. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ MessageEdited was ignoring NewMessage constructor arguments. Fixes for Event.delete_messages which wouldn't handle MessageService . Bot API style IDs not working on :meth: client.get_input_entity . :meth: client.download_media didn't support PhotoSize . Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Less RPC are made when accessing the .sender and .chat of some events (mostly those that occur in a channel). You can send albums larger than 10 items (they will be sliced for you), as well as mixing normal files with photos. TLObject now have Python type hints. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Several documentation corrections. :meth: client.get_dialogs is only called once again when an entity is not found to avoid flood waits. Sessions overhaul (v0.18) \u00b6 Published at 2018/03/04 +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 75 | +-----------------------+ The Session 's have been revisited thanks to the work of @tulir and they now use an ABC <https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html> __ so you can easily implement your own! The default will still be a SQLiteSession , but you might want to use the new AlchemySessionContainer if you need. Refer to the section of the documentation on :ref: sessions for more. Breaking changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ events.MessageChanged doesn't exist anymore. Use the new events.MessageEdited and events.MessageDeleted instead. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ The mentioned addition of new session types. You can omit the event type on client.add_event_handler to use Raw . You can raise StopPropagation of events if you added several of them. .get_participants() can now get up to 90,000 members from groups with 100,000 if when aggressive=True , \"bypassing\" Telegram's limit. You now can access NewMessage.Event.pattern_match . Multiple captions are now supported when sending albums. client.send_message() has an optional file= parameter, so you can do events.reply(file='/path/to/photo.jpg') and similar. Added .input_ versions to events.ChatAction . You can now access the public .client property on events . New client.forward_messages , with its own wrapper on events , called event.forward_to(...) . Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ Silly bug regarding client.get_me(input_peer=True) . client.send_voice_note() was missing some parameters. client.send_file() plays better with streams now. Incoming messages from bots weren't working with whitelists. Markdown's URL regex was not accepting newlines. Better attempt at joining background update threads. Use the right peer type when a marked integer ID is provided. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Resolving events.Raw is now a no-op. Logging calls in the TcpClient to spot errors. events resolution is postponed until you are successfully connected, so you can attach them before starting the client. When an entity is not found, it is searched in all dialogs. This might not always be desirable but it's more comfortable for legitimate uses. Some non-persisting properties from the Session have been moved out. Further easing library usage (v0.17.4) \u00b6 Published at 2018/02/24 Some new things and patches that already deserved their own release. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ New pattern argument to NewMessage to easily filter messages. New .get_participants() convenience method to get members from chats. .send_message() now accepts a Message as the message parameter. You can now .get_entity() through exact name match instead username. Raise ProxyConnectionError instead looping forever so you can except it on your own code and behave accordingly. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ .parse_username would fail with www. or a trailing slash. events.MessageChanged would fail with UpdateDeleteMessages . You can now send b'byte strings' directly as files again. .send_file() was not respecting the original captions when passing another message (or media) as the file. Downloading media from a different data center would always log a warning for the first time. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Use req_pq_multi instead req_pq when generating auth_key . You can use .get_me(input_peer=True) if all you need is your self ID. New addition to the interactive client example to show peer information. Avoid special casing InputPeerSelf on some NewMessage events, so you can always safely rely on .sender to get the right ID. New small convenience functions (v0.17.3) \u00b6 Published at 2018/02/18 More bug fixes and a few others addition to make events easier to use. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ Use hachoir to extract video and audio metadata before upload. New .add_event_handler , .add_update_handler now deprecated. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ bot_token wouldn't work on .start() , and changes to password (now it will ask you for it if you don't provide it, as docstring hinted). .edit_message() was ignoring the formatting (e.g. markdown). Added missing case to the NewMessage event for normal groups. Accessing the .text of the NewMessage event was failing due to a bug with the markdown unparser. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ libssl is no longer an optional dependency. Use cryptg instead, which you can find on https://pypi.org/project/cryptg/ . New small convenience functions (v0.17.2) \u00b6 Published at 2018/02/15 Primarily bug fixing and a few welcomed additions. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ New convenience .edit_message() method on the TelegramClient . New .edit() and .delete() shorthands on the NewMessage event. Default to markdown parsing when sending and editing messages. Support for inline mentions when sending and editing messages. They work like inline urls (e.g. [text](@username) ) and also support the Bot-API style (see here <https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#formatting-options> __). Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ Periodically send GetStateRequest automatically to keep the server sending updates even if you're not invoking any request yourself. HTML parsing was failing due to not handling surrogates properly. .sign_up was not accepting int codes. Whitelisting more than one chat on events wasn't working. Video files are sent as a video by default unless force_document . Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ More logging calls to help spot some bugs in the future. Some more logic to retrieve input entities on events. Clarified a few parts of the documentation. Updates as Events (v0.17.1) \u00b6 Published at 2018/02/09 Of course there was more work to be done regarding updates, and it's here! The library comes with a new events module (which you will often import as from telethon import TelegramClient, events ). This are pretty much all the additions that come with this version change, but they are a nice addition. Refer to (removed broken link) to get started with events. Trust the Server with Updates (v0.17) \u00b6 Published at 2018/02/03 The library trusts the server with updates again. The library will not check for duplicates anymore, and when the server kicks us, it will run GetStateRequest so the server starts sending updates again (something it wouldn't do unless you invoked something, it seems). But this update also brings a few more changes! Additions ~~~~~~~~~ TLObject 's override __eq__ and __ne__ , so you can compare them. Added some missing cases on .get_input_entity() and peer functions. obj.to_dict() now has a '_' key with the type used. .start() can also sign up now. More parameters for .get_message_history() . Updated list of RPC errors. HTML parsing thanks to @tulir ! It can be used similar to markdown: client.send_message(..., parse_mode='html') . Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ client.send_file() now accepts Message 's and MessageMedia 's as the file parameter. Some documentation updates and fixed to clarify certain things. New exact match feature on https://tl.telethon.dev . Return as early as possible from .get_input_entity() and similar, to avoid penalizing you for doing this right. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ .download_media() wouldn't accept a Document as parameter. The SQLite is now closed properly on disconnection. IPv6 addresses shouldn't use square braces. Fix regarding .log_out() . The time offset wasn't being used (so having wrong system time would cause the library not to work at all). New .resolve() method (v0.16.2) \u00b6 Published at 2018/01/19 The TLObject 's (instances returned by the API and Request 's) have now acquired a new .resolve() method. While this should be used by the library alone (when invoking a request), it means that you can now use Peer types or even usernames where a InputPeer is required. The object now has access to the client , so that it can fetch the right type if needed, or access the session database. Furthermore, you can reuse requests that need \"autocast\" (e.g. you put :tl: User but InputPeer was needed), since .resolve() is called when invoking. Before, it was only done on object construction. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ Album support. Just pass a list, tuple or any iterable to .send_file() . Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ .start() asks for your phone only if required. Better file cache. All files under 10MB, once uploaded, should never be needed to be re-uploaded again, as the sent media is cached to the session. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ setup.py now calls gen_tl when installing the library if needed. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The mentioned .resolve() to perform \"autocast\", more powerful. Upload and download methods are no longer part of TelegramBareClient . Reuse .on_response() , .__str__ and .stringify() . Only override .on_response() if necessary (small amount of cases). Reduced \"autocast\" overhead as much as possible. You shouldn't be penalized if you've provided the right type. MtProto 2.0 (v0.16.1) \u00b6 Published at 2018/01/11 +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 74 | +-----------------------+ The library is now using MtProto 2.0! This shouldn't really affect you as an end user, but at least it means the library will be ready by the time MtProto 1.0 is deprecated. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ New .start() method, to make the library avoid boilerplate code. .send_file accepts a new optional thumbnail parameter, and returns the Message with the sent file. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ The library uses again only a single connection. Less updates are be dropped now, and the performance is even better than using temporary connections. without rowid will only be used on the *.session if supported. Phone code hash is associated with phone, so you can change your mind when calling .sign_in() . Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ File cache now relies on the hash of the file uploaded instead its path, and is now persistent in the *.session file. Report any bugs on this! Clearer error when invoking without being connected. Markdown parser doesn't work on bytes anymore (which makes it cleaner). Sessions as sqlite databases (v0.16) \u00b6 Published at 2017/12/28 In the beginning, session files used to be pickle. This proved to be bad as soon as one wanted to add more fields. For this reason, they were migrated to use JSON instead. But this proved to be bad as soon as one wanted to save things like entities (usernames, their ID and hash), so now it properly uses sqlite3 <https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html> __, which has been well tested, to save the session files! Calling .get_input_entity using a username no longer will need to fetch it first, so it's really 0 calls again. Calling .get_entity will always fetch the most up to date version. Furthermore, nearly everything has been documented, thus preparing the library for Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org/> (although there are a few things missing I'd like to polish first), and the logging <https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html> are now better placed. Breaking changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ .get_dialogs() now returns a single list instead a tuple consisting of a custom class that should make everything easier to work with. .get_message_history() also returns a single list instead a tuple, with the Message instances modified to make them more convenient. Both lists have a .total attribute so you can still know how many dialogs/messages are in total. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ The mentioned use of sqlite3 for the session file. .get_entity() now supports lists too, and it will make as little API calls as possible if you feed it InputPeer types. Usernames will always be resolved, since they may have changed. .set_proxy() method, to avoid having to create a new TelegramClient . More date types supported to represent a date parameter. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ Empty strings weren't working when they were a flag parameter (e.g., setting no last name). Fix invalid assertion regarding flag parameters as well. Avoid joining the background thread on disconnect, as it would be None due to a race condition. Correctly handle None dates when downloading media. .download_profile_photo was failing for some channels. .download_media wasn't handling Photo . Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ date was being serialized as local date, but that was wrong. date was being represented as a float instead of an int . .tl parser wasn't stripping inline comments. Removed some redundant checks on update_state.py . Use a synchronized queue <https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html> __ instead a hand crafted version. Use signed integers consistently (e.g. salt ). Always read the corresponding TLObject from API responses, except for some special cases still. A few more except low level to correctly wrap errors. More accurate exception types. invokeWithLayer(initConnection(X)) now wraps every first request after .connect() . As always, report if you have issues with some of the changes! IPv6 support (v0.15.5) \u00b6 Published at 2017/11/16 +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 73 | +-----------------------+ It's here, it has come! The library now supports IPv6 ! Just pass use_ipv6=True when creating a TelegramClient . Note that I could not test this feature because my machine doesn't have IPv6 setup. If you know IPv6 works in your machine but the library doesn't, please refer to #425 <https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/issues/425> _. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ IPv6 support. New method to extract the text surrounded by MessageEntity \\ 's, in the extensions.markdown module. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Markdown parsing is Done Right. Reconnection on failed invoke. Should avoid \"number of retries reached 0\" ( #270 ). Some missing autocast to Input* types. The library uses the NullHandler for logging as it should have always done. TcpClient.is_connected() is now more reliable. .. bug-fixes-1: Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ Getting an entity using their phone wasn't actually working. Full entities aren't saved unless they have an access_hash , to avoid some None errors. .get_message_history was failing when retrieving items that had messages forwarded from a channel. General enhancements (v0.15.4) \u00b6 Published at 2017/11/04 +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 72 | +-----------------------+ This update brings a few general enhancements that are enough to deserve a new release, with a new feature: beta markdown-like parsing for .send_message() ! .. additions-1: Additions ~~~~~~~~~ .send_message() supports parse_mode='md' for Markdown ! It works in a similar fashion to the official clients (defaults to double underscore/asterisk, like **this** ). Please report any issues with emojies or enhancements for the parser! New .idle() method so your main thread can do useful job (listen for updates). Add missing .to_dict() , __str__ and .stringify() for TLMessage and MessageContainer . .. bug-fixes-2: Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ The list of known peers could end \"corrupted\" and have users with access_hash=None , resulting in struct error for it not being an integer. You shouldn't encounter this issue anymore. The warning for \"added update handler but no workers set\" wasn't actually working. .get_input_peer was ignoring a case for InputPeerSelf . There used to be an exception when logging exceptions (whoops) on update handlers. \"Downloading contacts\" would produce strange output if they had semicolons ( ; ) in their name. Fix some cyclic imports and installing dependencies from the git repository. Code generation was using f-strings, which are only supported on Python \u22653.6. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The auth_key generation has been moved from .connect() to .invoke() . There were some issues were .connect() failed and the auth_key was None so this will ensure to have a valid auth_key when needed, even if BrokenAuthKeyError is raised. Support for higher limits on .get_history() and .get_dialogs() . Much faster integer factorization when generating the required auth_key . Thanks @delivrance for making me notice this, and for the pull request. Bug fixes with updates (v0.15.3) \u00b6 Published at 2017/10/20 Hopefully a very ungrateful bug has been removed. When you used to invoke some request through update handlers, it could potentially enter an infinite loop. This has been mitigated and it's now safe to invoke things again! A lot of updates were being dropped (all those gzipped), and this has been fixed too. More bug fixes include a correct parsing <https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/commit/ee01724cdb7027c1e38625d31446ba1ea7bade92> of certain TLObjects thanks to @stek29 , and some <https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/commit/ed77ba6f8ff115ac624f02f691c9991e5b37be60> wrong calls <https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/commit/16cf94c9add5e94d70c4eee2ac142d8e76af48b9> __ that would cause the library to crash thanks to @andr-04 , and the ReadThread not re-starting if you were already authorized. Internally, the .to_bytes() function has been replaced with __bytes__ so now you can do bytes(tlobject) . Bug fixes and new small features (v0.15.2) \u00b6 Published at 2017/10/14 This release primarly focuses on a few bug fixes and enhancements. Although more stuff may have broken along the way. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ You will be warned if you call .add_update_handler with no update_workers . New customizable threshold value on the session to determine when to automatically sleep on flood waits. See client.session.flood_sleep_threshold . New .get_drafts() method with a custom Draft class by @JosXa . Join all threads when calling .disconnect() , to assert no dangling thread is left alive. Larger chunk when downloading files should result in faster downloads. You can use a callable key for the EntityDatabase , so it can be any filter you need. .. bug-fixes-3: Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ .get_input_entity was failing for IDs and other cases, also making more requests than it should. Use basename instead abspath when sending a file. You can now also override the attributes. EntityDatabase.__delitem__ wasn't working. .send_message() was failing with channels. .get_dialogs(limit=None) should now return all the dialogs correctly. Temporary fix for abusive duplicated updates. .. enhancements-1: .. internal-changes-1: Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ MsgsAck is now sent in a container rather than its own request. .get_input_photo is now used in the generated code. .process_entities was being called from more places than only __call__ . MtProtoSender now relies more on the generated code to read responses. Custom Entity Database (v0.15.1) \u00b6 Published at 2017/10/05 The main feature of this release is that Telethon now has a custom database for all the entities you encounter, instead depending on @lru_cache on the .get_entity() method. The EntityDatabase will, by default, cache all the users, chats and channels you find in memory for as long as the program is running. The session will, by default, save all key-value pairs of the entity identifiers and their hashes (since Telegram may send an ID that it thinks you already know about, we need to save this information). You can prevent the EntityDatabase from saving users by setting client.session.entities.enabled = False , and prevent the Session from saving input entities at all by setting client.session.save_entities = False . You can also clear the cache for a certain user through client.session.entities.clear_cache(entity=None) , which will clear all if no entity is given. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ New method to .delete_messages() . New ChannelPrivateError class. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ .sign_in accepts phones as integers. Changing the IP to which you connect to is as simple as client.session.server_address = 'ip' , since now the server address is always queried from the session. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ .get_dialogs() doesn't fail on Windows anymore, and returns the right amount of dialogs. GeneralProxyError should be passed to the main thread again, so that you can handle it. Updates Overhaul Update (v0.15) \u00b6 Published at 2017/10/01 After hundreds of lines changed on a major refactor, it's finally here . It's the Updates Overhaul Update ; let's get right into it! Breaking changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ .create_new_connection() is gone for good. No need to deal with this manually since new connections are now handled on demand by the library itself. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ You can invoke requests from update handlers . And any other thread . A new temporary will be made, so that you can be sending even several requests at the same time! Several worker threads for your updates! By default, None will spawn. I recommend you to work with update_workers=4 to get started, these will be polling constantly for updates. You can also change the number of workers at any given time. The library can now run in a single thread again, if you don't need to spawn any at all. Simply set spawn_read_thread=False when creating the TelegramClient ! You can specify limit=None on .get_dialogs() to get all of them[1]. Updates are expanded , so you don't need to check if the update has .updates or an inner .update anymore. All InputPeer entities are saved in the session file, but you can disable this by setting save_entities=False . New .get_input_entity method, which makes use of the above feature. You should use this when a request needs a InputPeer , rather than the whole entity (although both work). Assert that either all or None dependent-flag parameters are set before sending the request. Phone numbers can have dashes, spaces, or parenthesis. They'll be removed before making the request. You can override the phone and its hash on .sign_in() , if you're creating a new TelegramClient on two different places. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ .log_out() was consuming all retries. It should work just fine now. The session would fail to load if the auth_key had been removed manually. Updates.check_error was popping wrong side, although it's been completely removed. ServerError \\ 's will be ignored , and the request will immediately be retried. Cross-thread safety when saving the session file. Some things changed on a matter of when to reconnect, so please report any bugs! .. internal-changes-2: Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ TelegramClient is now only an abstraction over the TelegramBareClient , which can only do basic things, such as invoking requests, working with files, etc. If you don't need any of the abstractions the TelegramClient , you can now use the TelegramBareClient in a much more comfortable way. MtProtoSender is not thread-safe, but it doesn't need to be since a new connection will be spawned when needed. New connections used to be cached and then reused. Now only their sessions are saved, as temporary connections are spawned only when needed. Added more RPC errors to the list. [1]: Broken due to a condition which should had been the opposite (sigh), fixed 4 commits ahead on 62ea77c . That's pretty much it , although there's more work to be done to make the overall experience of working with updates even better . Stay tuned! Serialization bug fixes (v0.14.2) \u00b6 Published at 2017/09/29 Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ Important , related to the serialization. Every object or request that had to serialize a True/False type was always being serialized as false ! Another bug that didn't allow you to leave as None flag parameters that needed a list has been fixed. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Other internal changes include a somewhat more readable .to_bytes() function and pre-computing the flag instead using bit shifting. The TLObject.constructor_id has been renamed to TLObject.CONSTRUCTOR_ID , and .subclass_of_id is also uppercase now. Farewell, BinaryWriter (v0.14.1) \u00b6 Published at 2017/09/28 Version v0.14 had started working on the new .to_bytes() method to dump the BinaryWriter and its usage on the .on_send() when serializing TLObjects, and this release finally removes it. The speed up when serializing things to bytes should now be over twice as fast wherever it's needed. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ This version is again compatible with Python 3.x versions below 3.5 (there was a method call that was Python 3.5 and above). Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Using proper classes (including the generated code) for generating authorization keys and to write out TLMessage \\ 's. Several requests at once and upload compression (v0.14) \u00b6 Published at 2017/09/27 New major release, since I've decided that these two features are big enough: Additions ~~~~~~~~~ Requests larger than 512 bytes will be compressed through gzip , and if the result is smaller, this will be uploaded instead. You can now send multiple requests at once , they're simply *var_args on the .invoke() . Note that the server doesn't guarantee the order in which they'll be executed! Internally, another important change. The .on_send function on the TLObjects is gone , and now there's a new .to_bytes() . From my tests, this has always been over twice as fast serializing objects, although more replacements need to be done, so please report any issues. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ - Implemented .get_input_media helper methods. Now you can even use another message as input media! Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ Downloading media from CDNs wasn't working (wrong access to a parameter). Correct type hinting. Added a tiny sleep when trying to perform automatic reconnection. Error reporting is done in the background, and has a shorter timeout. setup.py used to fail with wrongly generated code. Quick fix-up (v0.13.6) \u00b6 Published at 2017/09/23 Before getting any further, here's a quick fix-up with things that should have been on v0.13.5 but were missed. Specifically, the timeout when receiving a request will now work properly. Some other additions are a tiny fix when handling updates , which was ignoring some of them, nicer __str__ and .stringify() methods for the TLObject \\ 's, and not stopping the ReadThread if you try invoking something there (now it simply returns None ). Attempts at more stability (v0.13.5) \u00b6 Published at 2017/09/23 Yet another update to fix some bugs and increase the stability of the library, or, at least, that was the attempt! This release should really improve the experience with the background thread that the library starts to read things from the network as soon as it can, but I can't spot every use case, so please report any bug (and as always, minimal reproducible use cases will help a lot). .. bug-fixes-4: Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ setup.py was failing on Python < 3.5 due to some imports. Duplicated updates should now be ignored. .send_message would crash in some cases, due to having a typo using the wrong object. \"socket is None\" when calling .connect() should not happen anymore. BrokenPipeError was still being raised due to an incorrect order on the try/except block. .. enhancements-2: Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Type hinting for all the generated Request \\ 's and TLObjects ! IDEs like PyCharm will benefit from this. ProxyConnectionError should properly be passed to the main thread for you to handle. The background thread will only be started after you're authorized on Telegram (i.e. logged in), and several other attempts at polishing the experience with this thread. The Connection instance is only created once now, and reused later. Calling .connect() should have a better behavior now (like actually trying to connect even if we seemingly were connected already). .reconnect() behavior has been changed to also be more consistent by making the assumption that we'll only reconnect if the server has disconnected us, and is now private. .. other-changes-1: Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ TLObject.__repr__ doesn't show the original TL definition anymore, it was a lot of clutter. If you have any complaints open an issue and we can discuss it. Internally, the '+' from the phone number is now stripped, since it shouldn't be included. Spotted a new place where BrokenAuthKeyError would be raised, and it now is raised there. More bug fixes and enhancements (v0.13.4) \u00b6 Published at 2017/09/18 .. new-stuff-1: Additions ~~~~~~~~~ TelegramClient now exposes a .is_connected() method. Initial authorization on a new data center will retry up to 5 times by default. Errors that couldn't be handled on the background thread will be raised on the next call to .invoke() or updates.poll() . .. bugs-fixed-1: Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~~ Now you should be able to sign in even if you have process_updates=True and no previous session. Some errors and methods are documented a bit clearer. .send_message() could randomly fail, as the returned type was not expected. TimeoutError is now ignored, since the request will be retried up to 5 times by default. \"-404\" errors ( BrokenAuthKeyError \\ 's) are now detected when first connecting to a new data center. BufferError is handled more gracefully, in the same way as InvalidCheckSumError \\ 's. Attempt at fixing some \"NoneType has no attribute\u2026\" errors (with the .sender ). Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Calling GetConfigRequest is now made less often. The initial_query parameter from .connect() is gone, as it's not needed anymore. Renamed all_tlobjects.layer to all_tlobjects.LAYER (since it's a constant). The message from BufferError is now more useful. Bug fixes and enhancements (v0.13.3) \u00b6 Published at 2017/09/14 .. bugs-fixed-2: Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ Reconnection used to fail because it tried invoking things from the ReadThread . Inferring random ids for ForwardMessagesRequest wasn't working. Downloading media from CDNs failed due to having forgotten to remove a single line. TcpClient.close() now has a threading.Lock , so NoneType has no close() should not happen. New workaround for msg seqno too low/high . Also, both Session.id/seq are not saved anymore. .. enhancements-3: Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Request will be retried up to 5 times by default rather than failing on the first attempt. InvalidChecksumError \\ 's are now ignored by the library. TelegramClient.get_entity() is now public , and uses the @lru_cache() decorator. New method to .send_voice_note() \\ 's. Methods to send message and media now support a reply_to parameter . .send_message() now returns the full message which was just sent. New way to work with updates (v0.13.2) \u00b6 Published at 2017/09/08 This update brings a new way to work with updates, and it's begging for your feedback , or better names or ways to do what you can do now. Please refer to the wiki/Usage Modes <https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/wiki/Usage-Modes> __ for an in-depth description on how to work with updates now. Notice that you cannot invoke requests from within handlers anymore, only the v.0.13.1 patch allowed you to do so. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ Periodic pings are back. The username regex mentioned on UsernameInvalidError was invalid, but it has now been fixed. Sending a message to a phone number was failing because the type used for a request had changed on layer 71. CDN downloads weren't working properly, and now a few patches have been applied to ensure more reliability, although I couldn't personally test this, so again, report any feedback. Invoke other requests from within update callbacks (v0.13.1) \u00b6 Published at 2017/09/04 .. warning:: This update brings some big changes to the update system, so please read it if you work with them! A silly \"bug\" which hadn't been spotted has now been fixed. Now you can invoke other requests from within your update callbacks. However this is not advised . You should post these updates to some other thread, and let that thread do the job instead. Invoking a request from within a callback will mean that, while this request is being invoked, no other things will be read. Internally, the generated code now resides under a lot less files, simply for the sake of avoiding so many unnecessary files. The generated code is not meant to be read by anyone, simply to do its job. Unused attributes have been removed from the TLObject class too, and .sign_up() returns the user that just logged in in a similar way to .sign_in() now. Connection modes (v0.13) \u00b6 Published at 2017/09/04 +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 71 | +-----------------------+ The purpose of this release is to denote a big change, now you can connect to Telegram through different **connection modes** <https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/blob/v0.13/telethon/network/connection.py> __. Also, a second thread will always be started when you connect a TelegramClient , despite whether you'll be handling updates or ignoring them, whose sole purpose is to constantly read from the network. The reason for this change is as simple as \"reading and writing shouldn't be related\" . Even when you're simply ignoring updates, this way, once you send a request you will only need to read the result for the request. Whatever Telegram sent before has already been read and outside the buffer. .. additions-2: Additions ~~~~~~~~~ The mentioned different connection modes, and a new thread. You can modify the Session attributes through the TelegramClient constructor (using **kwargs ). RPCError \\ 's now belong to some request you've made, which makes more sense. get_input_* now handles None (default) parameters more gracefully (it used to crash). .. enhancements-4: Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ The low-level socket doesn't use a handcrafted timeout anymore, which should benefit by avoiding the arbitrary sleep(0.1) that there used to be. TelegramClient.sign_in will call .send_code_request if no code was provided. Deprecation ~~~~~~~~~~~ .sign_up does not take a phone argument anymore. Change this or you will be using phone as code , and it will fail! The definition looks like def sign_up(self, code, first_name, last_name='') . The old JsonSession finally replaces the original Session (which used pickle). If you were overriding any of these, you should only worry about overriding Session now. Added verification for CDN file (v0.12.2) \u00b6 Published at 2017/08/28 Since the Content Distributed Network (CDN) is not handled by Telegram itself, the owners may tamper these files. Telegram sends their sha256 sum for clients to implement this additional verification step, which now the library has. If any CDN has altered the file you're trying to download, CdnFileTamperedError will be raised to let you know. Besides this. TLObject.stringify() was showing bytes as lists (now fixed) and RPC errors are reported by default: In an attempt to help everyone who works with the Telegram API, Telethon will by default report all Remote Procedure Call errors to `PWRTelegram <https://pwrtelegram.xyz/>`__, a public database anyone can query, made by `Daniil <https://github.com/danog>`__. All the information sent is a GET request with the error code, error message and method used. .. note:: If you still would like to opt out, simply set ``client.session.report_errors = False`` to disable this feature. However Daniil would really thank you if you helped him (and everyone) by keeping it on! CDN support (v0.12.1) \u00b6 Published at 2017/08/24 The biggest news for this update are that downloading media from CDN's (you'll often encounter this when working with popular channels) now works . Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ The method used to download documents crashed because two lines were swapped. Determining the right path when downloading any file was very weird, now it's been enhanced. The .sign_in() method didn't support integer values for the code! Now it does again. Some important internal changes are that the old way to deal with RSA public keys now uses a different module instead the old strange hand-crafted version. Hope the new, super simple README.rst encourages people to use Telethon and make it better with either suggestions, or pull request. Pull requests are super appreciated, but showing some support by leaving a star also feels nice \u2b50\ufe0f. Newbie friendly update (v0.12) \u00b6 Published at 2017/08/22 +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 70 | +-----------------------+ This update is overall an attempt to make Telethon a bit more user friendly, along with some other stability enhancements, although it brings quite a few changes. Breaking changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The TelegramClient methods .send_photo_file() , .send_document_file() and .send_media_file() are now a single method called .send_file() . It's also important to note that the order of the parameters has been swapped : first to who you want to send it, then the file itself. The same applies to .download_msg_media() , which has been renamed to .download_media() . The method now supports a Message itself too, rather than only Message.media . The specialized .download_photo() , .download_document() and .download_contact() still exist, but are private. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ Updated to layer 70 ! Both downloading and uploading now support stream-like objects . A lot faster initial connection if sympy is installed (can be installed through pip ). libssl will also be used if available on your system (likely on Linux based systems). This speed boost should also apply to uploading and downloading files. You can use a phone number or an username for methods like .send_message() , .send_file() , and all the other quick-access methods provided by the TelegramClient . .. bug-fixes-5: Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ Crashing when migrating to a new layer and receiving old updates should not happen now. InputPeerChannel is now casted to InputChannel automtically too. .get_new_msg_id() should now be thread-safe. No promises. Logging out on macOS caused a crash, which should be gone now. More checks to ensure that the connection is flagged correctly as either connected or not. .. note:: Downloading files from CDN's will not work yet (something new that comes with layer 70). That's it, any new idea or suggestion about how to make the project even more friendly is highly appreciated. .. note:: Did you know that you can pretty print any result Telegram returns (called ``TLObject``\\ 's) by using their ``.stringify()`` function? Great for debugging! get_input_* now works with vectors (v0.11.5) \u00b6 Published at 2017/07/11 Quick fix-up of a bug which hadn't been encountered until now. Auto-cast by using get_input_* now works. get_input_* everywhere (v0.11.4) \u00b6 Published at 2017/07/10 For some reason, Telegram doesn't have enough with the InputPeer <https://tl.telethon.dev/types/input_peer.html> . There also exist InputChannel <https://tl.telethon.dev/types/input_channel.html> and InputUser <https://tl.telethon.dev/types/input_user.html> __! You don't have to worry about those anymore, it's handled internally now. Besides this, every Telegram object now features a new default .__str__ look, and also a .stringify() method <https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/commit/8fd0d7eadd944ff42e18aaf06228adc7aba794b5> __ to pretty format them, if you ever need to inspect them. The library now uses the DEBUG level <https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/commit/1f7ac7118750ed84e2165dce9c6aca2e6ea0c6a4> __ everywhere, so no more warnings or information messages if you had logging enabled. The no_webpage parameter from .send_message has been renamed <https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/commit/0119a006585acd1a1a9a8901a21bb2f193142cfe> __ to link_preview for clarity, so now it does the opposite (but has a clearer intention). Quick .send_message() fix (v0.11.3) \u00b6 Published at 2017/07/05 A very quick follow-up release to fix a tiny bug with .send_message() , no new features. Callable TelegramClient (v0.11.2) \u00b6 Published at 2017/07/04 +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 68 | +-----------------------+ There is a new preferred way to invoke requests , which you're encouraged to use: .. code:: python # New! result = client(SomeRequest()) # Old. result = client.invoke(SomeRequest()) Existing code will continue working, since the old .invoke() has not been deprecated. When you .create_new_connection() , it will also handle FileMigrateError \\ 's for you, so you don't need to worry about those anymore. .. bugs-fixed-3: Bugs fixes ~~~~~~~~~~ Fixed some errors when installing Telethon via pip (for those using either source distributions or a Python version \u2264 3.5). ConnectionResetError didn't flag sockets as closed, but now it does. On a more technical side, msg_id \\ 's are now more accurate. Improvements to the updates (v0.11.1) \u00b6 Published at 2017/06/24 Receiving new updates shouldn't miss any anymore, also, periodic pings are back again so it should work on the long run. On a different order of things, .connect() also features a timeout. Notice that the timeout= is not passed as a parameter anymore, and is instead specified when creating the TelegramClient . Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ Fixed some name class when a request had a .msg_id parameter. The correct amount of random bytes is now used in DH request Fixed CONNECTION_APP_VERSION_EMPTY when using temporary sessions. Avoid connecting if already connected. Support for parallel connections (v0.11) \u00b6 Published at 2017/06/16 This update brings a lot of changes, so it would be nice if you could read the whole change log ! Breaking changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Every Telegram error has now its own class , so it's easier to fine-tune your except \\ 's. Markdown parsing is not part of Telethon itself anymore, although there are plans to support it again through a some external module. The .list_sessions() has been moved to the Session class instead. The InteractiveTelegramClient is not shipped with pip anymore. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ A new, more lightweight class has been added. The TelegramBareClient is now the base of the normal TelegramClient , and has the most basic features. New method to .create_new_connection() , which can be ran in parallel with the original connection. This will return the previously mentioned TelegramBareClient already connected. Any file object can now be used to download a file (for instance, a BytesIO() instead a file name). Vales like random_id are now automatically inferred , so you can save yourself from the hassle of writing generate_random_long() everywhere. Same applies to .get_input_peer() , unless you really need the extra performance provided by skipping one if if called manually. Every type now features a new .to_dict() method. .. bug-fixes-6: Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ Received errors are acknowledged to the server, so they don't happen over and over. Downloading media on different data centers is now up to x2 faster , since there used to be an InvalidDCError for each file part tried to be downloaded. Lost messages are now properly skipped. New way to handle the result of requests . The old ValueError \" The previously sent request must be resent. However, no request was previously sent (possibly called from a different thread). \" should not happen anymore. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Some fixes to the JsonSession . Fixed possibly crashes if trying to .invoke() a Request while .reconnect() was being called on the UpdatesThread . Some improvements on the TcpClient , such as not switching between blocking and non-blocking sockets. The code now uses ASCII characters only. Some enhancements to .find_user_or_chat() and .get_input_peer() . JSON session file (v0.10.1) \u00b6 Published at 2017/06/07 This version is primarily for people to migrate their .session files, which are pickled , to the new JSON format. Although slightly slower, and a bit more vulnerable since it's plain text, it's a lot more resistant to upgrades. .. warning:: You **must** upgrade to this version before any higher one if you've used Telethon \u2264 v0.10. If you happen to upgrade to an higher version, that's okay, but you will have to manually delete the ``*.session`` file, and logout from that session from an official client. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ New .get_me() function to get the current user. .is_user_authorized() is now more reliable. New nice button to copy the from telethon.tl.xxx.yyy import Yyy on the online documentation. More error codes added to the errors file. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Everything on the documentation is now, theoretically, sorted alphabetically . No second thread is spawned unless one or more update handlers are added. Full support for different DCs and ++stable (v0.10) \u00b6 Published at 2017/06/03 Working with different data centers finally works ! On a different order of things, reconnection is now performed automatically every time Telegram decides to kick us off their servers, so now Telethon can really run forever and ever ! In theory. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Documentation improvements, such as showing the return type. The msg_id too low/high error should happen less often , if any. Sleeping on the main thread is not done anymore . You will have to except FloodWaitError \\ 's. You can now specify your own application version , device model, system version and language code. Code is now more pythonic (such as making some members private), and other internal improvements (which affect the updates thread ), such as using logger instead a bare print() too. This brings Telethon a whole step closer to v1.0 , though more things should preferably be changed. Stability improvements (v0.9.1) \u00b6 Published at 2017/05/23 Telethon used to crash a lot when logging in for the very first time. The reason for this was that the reconnection (or dead connections) were not handled properly. Now they are, so you should be able to login directly, without needing to delete the *.session file anymore. Notice that downloading from a different DC is still a WIP. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Updates thread is only started after a successful login. Files meant to be ran by the user now use shebangs and proper permissions. In-code documentation now shows the returning type. Relative import is now used everywhere, so you can rename telethon to anything else. Dead connections are now detected instead entering an infinite loop. Sockets can now be closed (and re-opened) properly. Telegram decided to update the layer 66 without increasing the number. This has been fixed and now we're up-to-date again. General improvements (v0.9) \u00b6 Published at 2017/05/19 +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 66 | +-----------------------+ Additions ~~~~~~~~~ The documentation , available online here <https://tl.telethon.dev/> __, has a new search bar. Better cross-thread safety by using threading.Event . More improvements for running Telethon during a long period of time . Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ Avoid a certain crash on login (occurred if an unexpected object ID was received). Avoid crashing with certain invalid UTF-8 strings. Avoid crashing on certain terminals by using known ASCII characters where possible. The UpdatesThread is now a daemon, and should cause less issues. Temporary sessions didn't actually work (with session=None ). Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ .get_dialogs(count= was renamed to .get_dialogs(limit= . Bot login and proxy support (v0.8) \u00b6 Published at 2017/04/14 Additions ~~~~~~~~~ Bot login , thanks to @JuanPotato for hinting me about how to do it. Proxy support , thanks to @exzhawk for implementing it. Logging support , used by passing --telethon-log=DEBUG (or INFO ) as a command line argument. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ Connection fixes, such as avoiding connection until .connect() is explicitly invoked. Uploading big files now works correctly. Fix uploading big files. Some fixes on the updates thread, such as correctly sleeping when required. Long-run bug fix (v0.7.1) \u00b6 Published at 2017/02/19 If you're one of those who runs Telethon for a long time (more than 30 minutes), this update by @strayge will be great for you. It sends periodic pings to the Telegram servers so you don't get disconnected and you can still send and receive updates! Two factor authentication (v0.7) \u00b6 Published at 2017/01/31 +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 62 | +-----------------------+ If you're one of those who love security the most, these are good news. You can now use two factor authentication with Telethon too! As internal changes, the coding style has been improved, and you can easily use custom session objects, and various little bugs have been fixed. Updated pip version (v0.6) \u00b6 Published at 2016/11/13 +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 57 | +-----------------------+ This release has no new major features. However, it contains some small changes that make using Telethon a little bit easier. Now those who have installed Telethon via pip can also take advantage of changes, such as less bugs, creating empty instances of TLObjects , specifying a timeout and more! Ready, pip, go! (v0.5) \u00b6 Published at 2016/09/18 Telethon is now available as a Python package <https://pypi.python.org/pypi?name=Telethon> __ ! Those are really exciting news (except, sadly, the project structure had to change a lot to be able to do that; but hopefully it won't need to change much more, any more!) Not only that, but more improvements have also been made: you're now able to both sign up and logout , watch a pretty \"Uploading/Downloading\u2026 x%\" progress, and other minor changes which make using Telethon easier . Made InteractiveTelegramClient cool (v0.4) \u00b6 Published at 2016/09/12 Yes, really cool! I promise. Even though this is meant to be a library , that doesn't mean it can't have a good interactive client for you to try the library out. This is why now you can do many, many things with the InteractiveTelegramClient : List dialogs (chats) and pick any you wish. Send any message you like, text, photos or even documents. List the latest messages in the chat. Download any message's media (photos, documents or even contacts!). Receive message updates as you talk (i.e., someone sent you a message). It actually is an usable-enough client for your day by day. You could even add libnotify and pop, you're done! A great cli-client with desktop notifications. Also, being able to download and upload media implies that you can do the same with the library itself. Did I need to mention that? Oh, and now, with even less bugs! I hope. Media revolution and improvements to update handling! (v0.3) \u00b6 Published at 2016/09/11 Telegram is more than an application to send and receive messages. You can also send and receive media . Now, this implementation also gives you the power to upload and download media from any message that contains it! Nothing can now stop you from filling up all your disk space with all the photos! If you want to, of course. Handle updates in their own thread! (v0.2) \u00b6 Published at 2016/09/10 This version handles updates in a different thread (if you wish to do so). This means that both the low level TcpClient and the not-so-low-level MtProtoSender are now multi-thread safe, so you can use them with more than a single thread without worrying! This also implies that you won't need to send a request to receive an update (is someone typing? did they send me a message? has someone gone offline?). They will all be received instantly . Some other cool examples of things that you can do: when someone tells you \" Hello \", you can automatically reply with another \" Hello \" without even needing to type it by yourself :) However, be careful with spamming!! Do not use the program for that! First working alpha version! (v0.1) \u00b6 Published at 2016/09/06 +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 55 | +-----------------------+ There probably are some bugs left, which haven't yet been found. However, the majority of code works and the application is already usable! Not only that, but also uses the latest scheme as of now and handles way better the errors.

Scheduled Messages (v1.10) ========================== *Published at 2019/09/08* +------------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 105 | +------------------------+ You can now schedule messages to be sent (or edited, or forwarded\u2026) at a later time, which can also work as reminders for yourself when used in your own chat! .. code-block:: python from datetime import timedelta # Remind yourself to walk the dog in 10 minutes (after you play with Telethon's update) await client.send_message('me', 'Walk the dog', schedule=timedelta(minutes=10)) # Remind your friend tomorrow to update Telethon await client.send_message(friend, 'Update Telethon!', schedule=timedelta(days=1)) Additions New Button.auth <telethon.tl.custom.button.Button.auth> friendly button you can use to ask users to login to your bot. Telethon's repository now contains *.nix expressions that you can use. New client.kick_participant() <telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.kick_participant> method to truly kick (not ban) participants. New schedule parameter in client.send_message() <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.send_message> , client.edit_message() <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.edit_message> , client.forward_messages() <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.forward_messages> and client.send_file() <telethon.client.uploads.UploadMethods.send_file> . Bug fixes * Fix calling ``flush`` on file objects which lack this attribute. * Fix `CallbackQuery <telethon.events.callbackquery.CallbackQuery>` pattern. * Fix `client.action() <telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.action>` not returning itself when used in a context manager (so the ``as`` would be `None`). * Fix sending :tl:`InputKeyboardButtonUrlAuth` as inline buttons. * Fix `client.edit_permissions() <telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.edit_permissions>` defaults. * Fix `Forward <telethon.tl.custom.forward.Forward>` had its ``client`` as `None`. * Fix (de)serialization of negative timestamps (caused by the information in some sites with instant view, where the date could be very old). * Fix HTML un-parsing. * Fix ``to/from_id`` in private messages when using multiple clients. * Stop disconnecting from `None` (incorrect logging). * Fix double-read on double-connect. * Fix `client.get_messages() <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.get_messages>` when being passed more than 100 IDs. * Fix `Message.document <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.document>` for documents coming from web-pages. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ * Some documentation improvements, including the TL reference. * Documentation now avoids ``telethon.sync``, which should hopefully be less confusing. * Better error messages for flood wait. * You can now `client.get_drafts() <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.get_drafts>` for a single entity (which means you can now get a single draft from a single chat). * New-style file IDs now work with Telethon. * The ``progress_callback`` for `client.upload_file() <telethon.client.uploads.UploadMethods.upload_file>` can now be an ``async def``. Animated Stickers (v1.9) ======================== *Published at 2019/07/06* +------------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 103 | +------------------------+ With the layer 103, Telethon is now able to send and receive animated stickers! These use the ``'application/x-tgsticker'`` mime-type and for now, you can access its raw data, which is a gzipped JSON. Additions New events.Album <telethon.events.album.Album> to easily receive entire albums! New client.edit_admin() <telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.edit_admin> and client.edit_permissions() <telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.edit_permissions> methods to more easily manage your groups. New pattern= in CallbackQuery <telethon.events.callbackquery.CallbackQuery> . New conversation.cancel_all() <telethon.tl.custom.conversation.Conversation.cancel> method, to cancel all currently-active conversations in a particular chat. New telethon.utils.encode_waveform and telethon.utils.decode_waveform methods as implemented by Telegram Desktop, which lets you customize how voice notes will render. New ignore_pinned parameter in client.iter_dialogs() <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.iter_dialogs> . New Message.mark_read() <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.mark_read> method. You can now use strike-through in markdown with ~~text~~ , and the corresponding HTML tags for strike-through, quotes and underlined text. You can now nest entities, as in **__text__** . Bug fixes * Fixed downloading contacts. * Fixed `client.iter_dialogs() <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.iter_dialogs>` missing some under certain circumstances. * Fixed incredibly slow imports under some systems due to expensive path resolution when searching for ``libssl``. * Fixed captions when sending albums. * Fixed invalid states in `Conversation <telethon.tl.custom.conversation.Conversation>`. * Fixes to some methods in utils regarding extensions. * Fixed memory cycle in `Forward <telethon.tl.custom.forward.Forward>` which let you do things like the following: .. code-block:: python original_fwd = message.forward.original_fwd.original_fwd.original_fwd.original_fwd.original_fwd.original_fwd Hopefully you didn't rely on that in your code. * Fixed `File.ext <telethon.tl.custom.file.File.ext>` not working on unknown mime-types, despite the file name having the extension. * Fixed ``ids=..., reverse=True`` in `client.iter_messages() <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.iter_messages>`. * Fixed `Draft <telethon.tl.custom.draft.Draft>` not being aware of the entity. * Added missing re-exports in ``telethon.sync``. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ * Improved `conversation.cancel() <telethon.tl.custom.conversation.Conversation.cancel>` behaviour. Now you can use it from anywhere. * The ``progress_callback`` in `client.download_media() <telethon.client.downloads.DownloadMethods.download_media>` now lets you use ``async def``. * Improved documentation and the online method reference at https://tl.telethon.dev. Documentation Overhaul (v1.8) ============================= *Published at 2019/05/30* +------------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 100 | +------------------------+ The documentation has been completely reworked from the ground up, with awesome new quick references such as :ref:`client-ref` to help you quickly find what you need! Raw methods also warn you when a friendly variant is available, so that you don't accidentally make your life harder than it has to be. In addition, all methods in the client now are fully annotated with type hints! More work needs to be done, but this should already help a lot when using Telethon from any IDEs. You may have noticed that the patch versions between ``v1.7.2`` to ``v1.7.7`` have not been documented. This is because patch versions should only contain bug fixes, no new features or breaking changes. This hasn't been the case in the past, but from now on, the library will try to adhere more strictly to the `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org>`_ principles. If you ever want to look at those bug fixes, please use the appropriated ``git`` command, such as ``git shortlog v1.7.1...v1.7.4``, but in general, they probably just fixed your issue. With that out of the way, let's look at the full change set: Breaking Changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ * The layer changed, so take note if you use the raw API, as it's usual. * The way photos are downloaded changed during the layer update of the previous version, and fixing that bug as a breaking change in itself. `client.download_media() <telethon.client.downloads.DownloadMethods.download_media>` now offers a different way to deal with thumbnails. Additions New Message.file <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.file> property! Now you can trivially access message.file.id <telethon.tl.custom.file.File.id> to get the file ID of some media, or even print(message.file.name) . Archiving dialogs with Dialog.archive() <telethon.tl.custom.dialog.Dialog.archive> or client.edit_folder() <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.edit_folder> is now possible. New cleaned-up method to stream downloads with client.iter_download() <telethon.client.downloads.DownloadMethods.iter_download> , which offers a lot of flexibility, such as arbitrary offsets for efficient seeking. Dialog.delete() <telethon.tl.custom.dialog.Dialog.delete> has existed for a while, and now client.delete_dialog() <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.delete_dialog> exists too so you can easily leave chats or delete dialogs without fetching all dialogs. Some people or chats have a lot of profile photos. You can now iterate over all of them with the new client.iter_profile_photos() <telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.iter_profile_photos> method. You can now annoy everyone with the new Message.pin(notify=True) <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.pin> ! The client has its own variant too, called client.pin_message() <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.pin_message> . Bug fixes * Correctly catch and raise all RPC errors. * Downloading stripped photos wouldn't work correctly. * Under some systems, ``libssl`` would fail to load earlier than expected, causing the library to fail when being imported. * `conv.get_response() <telethon.tl.custom.conversation.Conversation.get_response>` after ID 0 wasn't allowed when it should. * `InlineBuilder <telethon.tl.custom.inlinebuilder.InlineBuilder>` only worked with local files, but files from anywhere are supported. * Accessing the text property from a raw-API call to fetch :tl:`Message` would fail (any any other property that needed the client). * Database is now upgraded if the version was lower, not different. From now on, this should help with upgrades and downgrades slightly. * Fixed saving ``pts`` and session-related stuff. * Disconnection should not raise any errors. * Invite links of the form ``tg://join?invite=`` now work. * `client.iter_participants(search=...) <telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.iter_participants>` now works on private chats again. * Iterating over messages in reverse with a date as offset wouldn't work. * The conversation would behave weirdly when a timeout occurred. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ * ``telethon`` now re-export all the goodies that you commonly need when using the library, so e.g. ``from telethon import Button`` will now work. * ``telethon.sync`` now re-exports everything from ``telethon``, so that you can trivially import from just one place everything that you need. * More attempts at reducing CPU usage after automatically fetching missing entities on events. This isn't a big deal, even if it sounds like one. * Hexadecimal invite links are now supported. You didn't need them, but they will now work. Internal Changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ * Deterministic code generation. This is good for ``diff``. * On Python 3.7 and above, we properly close the connection. * A lot of micro-optimization. * Fixes to bugs introduced while making this release. * Custom commands on ``setup.py`` are nicer to use. Fix-up for Photo Downloads (v1.7.1) =================================== *Published at 2019/04/24* Telegram changed the way thumbnails (which includes photos) are downloaded, so you can no longer use a :tl:`PhotoSize` alone to download a particular thumbnail size (this is a **breaking change**). Instead, you will have to specify the new ``thumb`` parameter in `client.download_media() <telethon.client.downloads.DownloadMethods.download_media>` to download a particular thumbnail size. This addition enables you to easily download thumbnails from documents, something you couldn't do easily before. Easier Events (v1.7) ==================== *Published at 2019/04/22* +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 98 | +-----------------------+ If you have been using Telethon for a while, you probably know how annoying the \"Could not find the input entity for\u2026\" error can be. In this new version, the library will try harder to find the input entity for you! That is, instead of doing: .. code-block:: python @client.on(events.NewMessage) async def handler(event): await client.download_profile_photo(await event.get_input_sender()) # ...... needs await, it's a method ^^^^^ ^^ You can now do: .. code-block:: python @client.on(events.NewMessage) async def handler(event): await client.download_profile_photo(event.input_sender) # ...... no await, it's a property! ^ # It's also 12 characters shorter :) And even the following will hopefully work: .. code-block:: python @client.on(events.NewMessage) async def handler(event): await client.download_profile_photo(event.sender_id) A lot of people use IDs thinking this is the right way of doing it. Ideally, you would always use ``input_*``, not ``sender`` or ``sender_id`` (and the same applies to chats). But, with this change, IDs will work just the same as ``input_*`` inside events. **This feature still needs some more testing**, so please do open an issue if you find strange behaviour. Breaking Changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ * The layer changed, and a lot of things did too. If you are using raw API, you should be careful with this. In addition, some attributes weren't of type ``datetime`` when they should be, which has been fixed. * Due to the layer change, you can no longer download photos with just their :tl:`PhotoSize`. Version 1.7.1 introduces a new way to download thumbnails to work around this issue. * `client.disconnect() <telethon.client.telegrambaseclient.TelegramBaseClient.disconnect>` is now asynchronous again. This means you need to ``await`` it. You don't need to worry about this if you were using ``with client`` or `client.run_until_disconnected <telethon.client.updates.UpdateMethods.run_until_disconnected>`. This should prevent the \"pending task was destroyed\" errors. Additions New in-memory cache for input entities. This should mean a lot less of disk look-ups. New client.action <telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.action> method to easily indicate that you are doing some chat action: .. code-block:: python async with client.action(chat, 'typing'): await asyncio.sleep(2) # type for 2 seconds await client.send_message(chat, 'Hello world! I type slow ^^') You can also easily use this for sending files, playing games, etc. New bugs ~~~~~~~~ Downloading photos is broken. This is fixed in v1.7.1. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ Fix sending photos from streams/bytes. Fix unhandled error when sending requests that were too big. Fix edits that arrive too early on conversations. Fix client.edit_message() <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.edit_message> when trying to edit a file. Fix method calls on the objects returned by client.iter_dialogs() <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.iter_dialogs> . Attempt at fixing client.iter_dialogs() <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.iter_dialogs> missing many dialogs. offset_date in client.iter_messages() <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.iter_messages> was being ignored in some cases. This has been worked around. Fix callback_query.edit() <telethon.events.callbackquery.CallbackQuery.Event.edit> . Fix CallbackQuery(func=...) <telethon.events.callbackquery.CallbackQuery> was being ignored. Fix UserUpdate <telethon.events.userupdate.UserUpdate> not working for \"typing\" (and uploading file, etc.) status. Fix library was not expecting IOError from PySocks. Fix library was raising a generic ConnectionError and not the one that actually occurred. Fix the blacklist_chats parameter in MessageRead <telethon.events.messageread.MessageRead> not working as intended. Fix client.download_media(contact) <telethon.client.downloads.DownloadMethods.download_media> . Fix mime type when sending mp3 files. Fix forcibly getting the sender or chat from events would not always return all their information. Fix sending albums with client.send_file() <telethon.client.uploads.UploadMethods.send_file> was not returning the sent messages. Fix forwarding albums with client.forward_messages() <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.forward_messages> . Some fixes regarding filtering updates from chats. Attempt at preventing duplicated updates. Prevent double auto-reconnect. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Some improvements related to proxy connections. Several updates and improvements to the documentation, such as optional dependencies now being properly listed. You can now forward messages from different chats directly with client.forward_messages <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.forward_messages> .","title":"Bug Fixes (v1.11)"},{"location":"misc/changelog/#tidying-up-internals-v16","text":"Published at 2019/02/27 +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 95 | +-----------------------+ First things first, sorry for updating the layer in the previous patch version. That should only be done between major versions ideally, but due to how Telegram works, it's done between minor versions. However raw API has and will always be considered \"unsafe\", this meaning that you should always use the convenience client methods instead. These methods don't cover the full API yet, so pull requests are welcome. Breaking Changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The layer update, of course. This didn't really need a mention here. You can no longer pass a batch_size when iterating over messages. No other method exposed this parameter, and it was only meant for testing purposes. Instead, it's now a private constant. client.iter_* methods no longer have a _total parameter which was supposed to be private anyway. Instead, they return a new generator object which has a .total attribute: .. code-block:: python it = client.iter_messages(chat) for i, message in enumerate(it, start=1): percentage = i / it.total print('{:.2%} {}'.format(percentage, message.text)) Additions ~~~~~~~~~ You can now pass phone and phone_code_hash in client.sign_up <telethon.client.auth.AuthMethods.sign_up> , although you probably don't need that. Thanks to the overhaul of all client.iter_* methods, you can now do: .. code-block:: python for message in reversed(client.iter_messages('me')): print(message.text) Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ Fix telethon.utils.resolve_bot_file_id , which wasn't working after the layer update (so you couldn't send some files by bot file IDs). Fix sending albums as bot file IDs (due to image detection improvements). Fix takeout() <telethon.client.account.AccountMethods.takeout> failing when they need to download media from other DCs. Fix repeatedly calling conversation.get_response() <telethon.tl.custom.conversation.Conversation.get_response> when many messages arrived at once (i.e. when several of them were forwarded). Fixed connecting with ConnectionTcpObfuscated <telethon.network.connection.tcpobfuscated.ConnectionTcpObfuscated> . Fix client.get_peer_id('me') <telethon.client.users.UserMethods.get_peer_id> . Fix warning of \"missing sqlite3\" when in reality it just had wrong tables. Fix a strange error when using too many IDs in client.delete_messages() <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.delete_messages> . Fix client.send_file <telethon.client.uploads.UploadMethods.send_file> with the result of client.upload_file <telethon.client.uploads.UploadMethods.upload_file> . When answering inline results, their order was not being preserved. Fix events.ChatAction <telethon.events.chataction.ChatAction> detecting user leaves as if they were kicked. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Cleared up some parts of the documentation. Improved some auto-casts to make life easier. Improved image detection. Now you can easily send bytes and streams of images as photos, unless you force document. Sending images as photos that are too large will now be resized before uploading, reducing the time it takes to upload them and also avoiding errors when the image was too large (as long as pillow is installed). The images will remain unchanged if you send it as a document. Treat errors.RpcMcgetFailError as a temporary server error to automatically retry shortly. This works around most issues. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ New common way to deal with retries ( retry_range ). Cleaned up the takeout client. Completely overhauled asynchronous generators.","title":"Tidying up Internals (v1.6)"},{"location":"misc/changelog/#layer-update-v155","text":"Published at 2019/01/14 +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 93 | +-----------------------+ There isn't an entry for v1.5.4 because it contained only one hot-fix regarding loggers.

Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ Dealing with mimetypes should cause less issues in systems like Windows. Potentially fix alternative session storages that had issues with dates.

Breaking Changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ message.edit <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.edit> now respects the previous message buttons or link preview being hidden. If you want to toggle them you need to explicitly set them. This is generally the desired behaviour, but may cause some bots to have buttons when they shouldn't. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ You can now \"hide_via\" when clicking on results from client.inline_query <telethon.client.bots.BotMethods.inline_query> to @bing and @gif . You can now further configure the logger Telethon uses to suit your needs. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ Fixes for ReadTheDocs to correctly build the documentation. Fix :tl: UserEmpty not being expected when getting the input variant. The message object returned when sending a message with buttons wouldn't always contain the :tl: ReplyMarkup . Setting email when configuring 2FA wasn't properly supported. utils.resolve_bot_file_id now works again for photos. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Chat and channel participants can now be used as peers.

Breaking Changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The layer change from 82 to 91 changed a lot of things in the raw API, so be aware that if you rely on raw API calls, you may need to update your code, in particular if you work with files . They have a new file_reference parameter that you must provide. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ New client.is_bot() <telethon.client.users.UserMethods.is_bot> method.

This means asyncio.open_connection is now used correctly and the errors it can produce are handled properly. The separation between packing, encrypting and network is now abstracted away properly, so reasoning about the code is easier, making it more maintainable. As a user, you shouldn't worry about this, other than being aware that quite a few changes were made in the insides of the library and you should report any issues that you encounter with this version if any. Breaking Changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The threaded version of the library will no longer be maintained, primarily because it never was properly maintained anyway. If you have old code, stick with old versions of the library, such as 0.19.1.6 . Timeouts no longer accept timedelta . Simply use seconds. The callback parameter from telethon.tl.custom.button.Button.inline() was removed, since it had always been a bad idea. Adding the callback there meant a lot of extra work for every message sent, and only registering it after the first message was sent! Instead, use telethon.events.callbackquery.CallbackQuery . Additions ~~~~~~~~~ New dialog.delete() <telethon.tl.custom.dialog.Dialog.delete> method. New conversation.cancel() <telethon.tl.custom.conversation.Conversation.cancel> method. New retry_delay delay for the client to be used on auto-reconnection. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ Fixed Conversation.wait_event() <telethon.tl.custom.conversation.Conversation.wait_event> .

Not using async with when needed is now a proper error. events.CallbackQuery <telethon.events.callbackquery.CallbackQuery> with string regex was not working properly. client.get_entity('me') <telethon.client.users.UserMethods.get_entity> now works again. Empty codes when signing in are no longer valid. Fixed file cache for in-memory sessions. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Support next_offset in inline_query.answer() <telethon.events.inlinequery.InlineQuery.Event.answer> . Support <a href=\"tg://user?id=123\"> mentions in HTML parse mode. New auto-casts for :tl: InputDocument and :tl: InputChatPhoto . Conversations are now exclusive per-chat by default. The request that caused a RPC error is now shown in the error message. New full API examples in the generated documentation. Fixed some broken links in the documentation. client.disconnect() <telethon.client.telegrambaseclient.TelegramBaseClient.disconnect> is now synchronous, but you can still await it for consistency or compatibility.","title":"Connection Overhaul (v1.4)"},{"location":"misc/changelog/#event-templates-v13","text":"Published at 2018/09/22 If you have worked with Flask templates, you will love this update, since it gives you the same features but even more conveniently: .. code-block:: python # handlers/welcome.py from telethon import events @events.register(events.NewMessage('(?i)hello')) async def handler(event): client = event.client await event.respond('Hi!') await client.send_message('me', 'Sent hello to someone') This will register <telethon.events.register> the handler callback to handle new message events. Note that you didn't add this to any client yet, and this is the key point: you don't need a client to define handlers! You can add it later: .. code-block:: python # main.py from telethon import TelegramClient import handlers.welcome with TelegramClient(...) as client: # This line adds the handler we defined before for new messages client.add_event_handler(handlers.welcome.handler) client.run_until_disconnected() This should help you to split your big code base into a more modular design. Breaking Changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ .sender is the .chat when the message is sent in a broadcast channel. This makes sense, because the sender of the message was the channel itself, but you now must take into consideration that it may be either a :tl: User or :tl: Channel instead of being None . Additions ~~~~~~~~~ New MultiError class when invoking many requests at once through client([requests]) . New custom func= on all events. These will receive the entire event, and a good usage example is func=lambda e: e.is_private . New .web_preview field on messages. The .photo and .document will also return the media in the web preview if any, for convenience. Callback queries now have a .chat in most circumstances. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ Running code with python3 -O would remove critical code from asserts. Fix some rare ghost disconnections after reconnecting. Fix strange behavior for send_message(chat, Message, reply_to=foo) <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.send_message> . The loop= argument was being pretty much ignored. Fix MemorySession file caching. The logic for getting entities from their username is now correct. Fixes for sending stickers from .webp files in Windows, again. Fix disconnection without being logged in. Retrieving media from messages would fail. Getting some messages by ID on private chats. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ iter_participants <telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.iter_participants> will now use its search= as a symbol set when aggressive=True , so you can do client.get_participants(group, aggressive=True, search='\u0430\u0431\u0432\u0433\u0434\u0435\u0451\u0436\u0437\u0438\u0439\u043a\u043b\u043c\u043d\u043e\u043f\u0440\u0441\u0442') . The StringSession supports custom encoding. Callbacks for telethon.client.auth.AuthMethods.start can be async .

Quite a few things have been added to the library, such as the new Conversation <telethon.tl.custom.conversation.Conversation> . This makes it trivial to get tokens from @BotFather <https://t.me/BotFather> _: .. code-block:: python from telethon.tl import types with client.conversation('BotFather') as conv: conv.send_message('/mybots') message = conv.get_response() message.click(0) message = conv.get_edit() message.click(0) message = conv.get_edit() for _, token in message.get_entities_text(types.MessageEntityCode): print(token) In addition to that, you can now easily load and export session files without creating any on-disk file thanks to the StringSession : .. code-block:: python from telethon.sessions import StringSession string = StringSession.save(client.session) Check out :ref: sessions for more details. For those who aren't able to install cryptg , the support for libssl has been added back. While interfacing libssl is not as fast, the speed when downloading and sending files should really be noticeably faster. While those are the biggest things, there are still more things to be excited about. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ The mentioned method to start a new client.conversation <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.conversation> . Implemented global search through client.iter_messages <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.iter_messages> with None entity. New client.inline_query <telethon.client.bots.BotMethods.inline_query> method to perform inline queries. Bot-API-style file_id can now be used to send files and download media. You can also access telethon.utils.resolve_bot_file_id and telethon.utils.pack_bot_file_id to resolve and create these file IDs yourself. Note that each user has its own ID for each file so you can't use a bot's file_id with your user, except stickers. New telethon.utils.get_peer , useful when you expect a :tl: Peer . Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ UTC timezone for telethon.events.userupdate.UserUpdate . Bug with certain input parameters when iterating messages. RPC errors without parent requests caused a crash, and better logging. incoming = outgoing = True was not working properly. Getting a message's ID was not working. File attributes not being inferred for open() 'ed files. Use MemorySession if sqlite3 is not installed by default. Self-user would not be saved to the session file after signing in. client.catch_up() <telethon.client.updates.UpdateMethods.catch_up> seems to be functional again. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Updated documentation. Invite links will now use cache, so using them as entities is cheaper. You can reuse message buttons to send new messages with those buttons. .to_dict() will now work even on invalid TLObject 's.","title":"Conversations, String Sessions and More (v1.2)"},{"location":"misc/changelog/#better-custom-message-v111","text":"Published at 2018/07/23 The custom.Message <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message> class has been rewritten in a cleaner way and overall feels less hacky in the library.

The release is primarily intended to test this big change, but also fixes Python 3.5.2 compatibility which was broken due to a trailing comma.

For this second option, there is an even better way: .. code-block:: python from telethon.tl.custom import Button async def callback(event): await event.edit('Thank you!') bot.send_message(chat, 'Hello!', buttons=Button.inline('Click me', callback)) You can directly pass the callback when creating the button. This is fine for small bots but it will add the callback every time you send a message, so you probably should do this instead once you are done testing: .. code-block:: python markup = bot.build_reply_markup(Button.inline('Click me', callback)) bot.send_message(chat, 'Hello!', buttons=markup) And yes, you can create more complex button layouts with lists: .. code-block:: python from telethon import events global phone = '' @bot.on(events.CallbackQuery) async def handler(event): global phone if event.data == b'<': phone = phone[:-1] else: phone += event.data.decode('utf-8') await event.answer('Phone is now {}'.format(phone)) markup = bot.build_reply_markup([ [Button.inline('1'), Button.inline('2'), Button.inline('3')], [Button.inline('4'), Button.inline('5'), Button.inline('6')], [Button.inline('7'), Button.inline('8'), Button.inline('9')], [Button.inline('+'), Button.inline('0'), Button.inline('<')], ]) bot.send_message(chat, 'Enter a phone', buttons=markup) (Yes, there are better ways to do this). Now for the rest of things: Additions ~~~~~~~~~ New custom.Button <telethon.tl.custom.button.Button> class to help you create inline (or normal) reply keyboards. You must sign in as a bot to use the buttons= parameters. New events usable if you sign in as a bot: events.InlineQuery <telethon.events.inlinequery.InlineQuery> and events.CallbackQuery <telethon.events.callbackquery.CallbackQuery> . New silent parameter when sending messages, usable in broadcast channels. Documentation now has an entire section dedicate to how to use the client's friendly methods at (removed broken link) . Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ Empty except are no longer used which means sending a keyboard interrupt should now work properly. The pts of incoming updates could be None . UTC timezone information is properly set for read datetime . Some infinite recursion bugs in the custom message class. :tl: Updates was being dispatched to raw handlers when it shouldn't. Using proxies and HTTPS connection mode may now work properly. Less flood waits when downloading media from different data centers, and the library will now detect them even before sending requests. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Interactive sign in now supports signing in with a bot token. timedelta is now supported where a date is expected, which means you can e.g. ban someone for timedelta(minutes=5) . Events are only built once and reused many times, which should save quite a few CPU cycles if you have a lot of the same type. You can now click inline buttons directly if you know their data.

This basically means that e.g. uploading 10 file parts at once will work properly again. Documentation fixes and some missing await . Revert named argument for client.forward_messages <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.forward_messages> Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ New auto-casts to :tl: InputNotifyPeer and chat_id .

This is useful when you need to make sure that all updates are processed in order, such as a script that only forwards incoming messages somewhere else. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ Count was always None for message.button_count <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.button_count> . Some fixes when disconnecting upon dropping the client. Support for Python 3.4 in the sync version, and fix media download. Some issues with events when accessing the input chat or their media.

This quick update should fix those, namely: Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ client.start() <telethon.client.auth.AuthMethods.start> was completely broken due to a last-time change requiring named arguments everywhere. Since the rewrite, if your system clock was wrong, the connection would get stuck in an infinite \"bad message\" loop of responses from Telegram. Accessing the buttons of a custom message wouldn't work in channels, which lead to fix a completely different bug regarding starting bots. Disconnecting could complain if the magic telethon.sync was imported. Successful automatic reconnections now ask Telegram to send updates to us once again as soon as the library is ready to listen for them.","title":"Bug Fixes (v1.0.1)"},{"location":"misc/changelog/#synchronous-magic-v10","text":"Published at 2018/06/27 .. important:: If you come from Telethon pre-1.0 you **really** want to read :ref:`compatibility-and-convenience` to port your scripts to the new version. The library has been around for well over a year. A lot of improvements have been made, a lot of user complaints have been fixed, and a lot of user desires have been implemented. It's time to consider the public API as stable, and remove some of the old methods that were around until now for compatibility reasons. But there's one more surprise! There is a new magic telethon.sync module to let you use all the methods in the :ref: TelegramClient <telethon-client> (and the types returned from its functions) in a synchronous way, while using asyncio behind the scenes! This means you're now able to do both of the following: .. code-block:: python import asyncio async def main(): await client.send_message('me', 'Hello!') asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main()) # ...can be rewritten as: from telethon import sync client.send_message('me', 'Hello!') Both ways can coexist (you need to await if the loop is running). You can also use the magic sync module in your own classes, and call sync.syncify(cls) to convert all their async def into magic variants. Breaking Changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ message.get_fwd_sender is now in message.forward <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.forward> . client.idle is now client.run_until_disconnected() <telethon.client.updates.UpdateMethods.run_until_disconnected> client.add_update_handler is now client.add_event_handler <telethon.client.updates.UpdateMethods.add_event_handler> client.remove_update_handler is now client.remove_event_handler <telethon.client.updates.UpdateMethods.remove_event_handler> client.list_update_handlers is now client.list_event_handlers <telethon.client.updates.UpdateMethods.list_event_handlers> client.get_message_history is now client.get_messages <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.get_messages> client.send_voice_note is now client.send_file <telethon.client.uploads.UploadMethods.send_file> with is_voice=True . client.invoke() is now client(...) . report_errors has been removed since it's currently not used, and flood_sleep_threshold is now part of the client. The update_workers and spawn_read_thread arguments are gone. Simply remove them from your code when you create the client. Methods with a lot of arguments can no longer be used without specifying their argument. Instead you need to use named arguments. This improves readability and not needing to learn the order of the arguments, which can also change. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ client.send_file <telethon.client.uploads.UploadMethods.send_file> now accepts external http:// and https:// URLs. You can use the :ref: TelegramClient <telethon-client> inside of with blocks, which will client.start() <telethon.client.auth.AuthMethods.start> and disconnect() <telethon.client.telegrambaseclient.TelegramBaseClient.disconnect> the client for you: .. code-block:: python from telethon import TelegramClient, sync with TelegramClient(name, api_id, api_hash) as client: client.send_message('me', 'Hello!') Convenience at its maximum! You can even chain the .start() <telethon.client.auth.AuthMethods.start> method since it returns the instance of the client: .. code-block:: python with TelegramClient(name, api_id, api_hash).start(bot_token=token) as bot: bot.send_message(chat, 'Hello!') Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ There were some @property async def left, and some await property . \"User joined\" event was being treated as \"User was invited\". SQLite's cursor should not be closed properly after usage. await the updates task upon disconnection. Some bug in Python 3.5.2's asyncio causing 100% CPU load if you forgot to call client.disconnect() <telethon.client.telegrambaseclient.TelegramBaseClient.disconnect> . The method is called for you on object destruction, but you still should disconnect manually or use a with block. Some fixes regarding disconnecting on client deletion and properly saving the authorization key. Passing a class to message.get_entities_text <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.get_entities_text> now works properly. Iterating messages from a specific user in private messages now works. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Both client.start() <telethon.client.auth.AuthMethods.start> and client.run_until_disconnected() <telethon.client.updates.UpdateMethods.run_until_disconnected> can be ran in both a synchronous way (without starting the loop manually) or from an async def where they need to have an await .","title":"Synchronous magic (v1.0)"},{"location":"misc/changelog/#core-rewrite-in-asyncio-v10-rc1","text":"Published at 2018/06/24 +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 81 | +-----------------------+ This version is a major overhaul of the library internals. The core has been rewritten, cleaned up and refactored to fix some oddities that have been growing inside the library. This means that the code is easier to understand and reason about, including the code flow such as conditions, exceptions, where to reconnect, how the library should behave, and separating different retry types such as disconnections or call fails, but it also means that some things will necessarily break in this version. All requests that touch the network are now methods and need to have their await (or be ran until their completion). Also, the library finally has the simple logo it deserved: a carefully hand-written .svg file representing a T following Python's colours. Breaking Changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ If you relied on internals like the MtProtoSender and the TelegramBareClient , both are gone. They are now MTProtoSender <telethon.network.mtprotosender.MTProtoSender> and TelegramBaseClient <telethon.client.telegrambaseclient.TelegramBaseClient> and they behave differently. Underscores have been renamed from filenames. This means telethon.errors.rpc_error_list won't work, but you should have been using telethon.errors all this time instead. client.connect <telethon.client.telegrambaseclient.TelegramBaseClient.connect> no longer returns True on success. Instead, you should except the possible ConnectionError and act accordingly. This makes it easier to not ignore the error. You can no longer set retries=n when calling a request manually. The limit works differently now, and it's done on a per-client basis. Accessing .sender <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.sender> , .chat <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.chat> and similar may not work in events anymore, since previously they could access the network. The new rule is that properties are not allowed to make API calls. You should use .get_sender() <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.get_sender> , .get_chat() <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.get_chat> instead while using events. You can safely access properties if you get messages through client.get_messages() <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.get_messages> or other methods in the client. The above point means reply_message is now .get_reply_message() <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.get_reply_message> , and fwd_from_entity is now get_fwd_sender() <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.get_fwd_sender> . Also forward was gone in the previous version, and you should be using fwd_from instead. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ Telegram's Terms Of Service are now accepted when creating a new account. This can possibly help avoid bans. This has no effect for accounts that were created before. The method reference <https://tl.telethon.dev/> _ now shows which methods can be used if you sign in with a bot_token . There's a new client.disconnected <telethon.client.telegrambaseclient.TelegramBaseClient.disconnected> future which you can wait on. When a disconnection occurs, you will now, instead letting it happen in the background. More configurable retries parameters, such as auto-reconnection, retries when connecting, and retries when sending a request. You can filter events.NewMessage <telethon.events.newmessage.NewMessage> by sender ID, and also whether they are forwards or not. New ignore_migrated parameter for client.iter_dialogs <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.iter_dialogs> . Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ Several fixes to telethon.events.newmessage.NewMessage . Removed named length argument in to_bytes for PyPy. Raw events failed due to not having ._set_client . message.get_entities_text <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.get_entities_text> properly supports filtering, even if there are no message entities. message.click <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.click> works better. The server started sending :tl: DraftMessageEmpty which the library didn't handle correctly when getting dialogs. The \"correct\" chat is now always returned from returned messages. to_id was not validated when retrieving messages by their IDs. '__' is no longer considered valid in usernames. The fd is removed from the reader upon closing the socket. This should be noticeable in Windows. :tl: MessageEmpty is now handled when searching messages. Fixed a rare infinite loop bug in client.iter_dialogs <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.iter_dialogs> for some people. Fixed TypeError when there is no .sender <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.sender> . Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ You can now delete over 100 messages at once with client.delete_messages <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.delete_messages> . Signing in now accounts for AuthRestartError itself, and also handles PasswordHashInvalidError . __all__ is now defined, so from telethon import * imports sane defaults (client, events and utils). This is however discouraged and should be used only in quick scripts. pathlib.Path is now supported for downloading and uploading media. Messages you send to yourself are now considered outgoing, unless they are forwarded. The documentation has been updated with a brand new asyncio crash course to encourage you use it. You can still use the threaded version if you want though. .name property is now properly supported when sending and downloading files. Custom parse_mode , which can now be set per-client, support :tl: MessageEntityMentionName so you can return those now. The session file is saved less often, which could result in a noticeable speed-up when working with a lot of incoming updates. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The flow for sending a request is as follows: the TelegramClient creates a MTProtoSender with a Connection , and the sender starts send and receive loops. Sending a request means enqueueing it in the sender, which will eventually pack and encrypt it with its ConnectionState instead of using the entire Session instance. When the data is packed, it will be sent over the Connection and ultimately over the TcpClient . Reconnection occurs at the MTProtoSender level, and receiving responses follows a similar process, but now asyncio.Future is used for the results which are no longer part of all TLObject , instead are part of the TLMessage which simplifies things. Objects can no longer be content_related and instead subclass TLRequest , making the separation of concerns easier. The TelegramClient has been split into several mixin classes to avoid having a 3,000-lines-long file with all the methods. More special cases in the MTProtoSender have been cleaned up, and also some attributes from the Session which didn't really belong there since they weren't being saved. The telethon_generator/ can now convert .tl files into .json , mostly as a proof of concept, but it might be useful for other people.","title":"Core Rewrite in asyncio (v1.0-rc1)"},{"location":"misc/changelog/#custom-message-class-v0191","text":"Published at 2018/06/03 +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 80 | +-----------------------+ This update brings a new telethon.tl.custom.message.Message object! All the methods in the telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient that used to return a :tl: Message will now return this object instead, which means you can do things like the following: .. code-block:: python msg = client.send_message(chat, 'Hello!') msg.edit('Hello there!') msg.reply('Good day!') print(msg.sender) Refer to its documentation to see all you can do, again, click telethon.tl.custom.message.Message to go to its page. Breaking Changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The telethon.network.connection.common.Connection class is now an ABC, and the old ConnectionMode is now gone.

Some short usernames like @vote were being ignored. telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.iter_messages 's from_user was failing if no filter had been set. telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.iter_messages 's min_id/max_id was being ignored by Telegram. This is now worked around. telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.catch_up would fail with empty states. telethon.events.newmessage.NewMessage supports incoming=False to indicate outgoing=True . Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ You can now send multiple requests at once while preserving the order: .. code-block:: python from telethon.tl.functions.messages import SendMessageRequest client([SendMessageRequest(chat, 'Hello 1!'), SendMessageRequest(chat, 'Hello 2!')], ordered=True) Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ without rowid is not used in SQLite anymore.

You can now use :meth: client.remove_event_handler and :meth: client.list_event_handlers similar how you could with normal updates. New properties on events.NewMessage , like .video_note and .gif to access only specific types of documents. The Draft class now exposes .text and .raw_text , as well as a new :meth: Draft.send to send it. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ MessageEdited was ignoring NewMessage constructor arguments. Fixes for Event.delete_messages which wouldn't handle MessageService . Bot API style IDs not working on :meth: client.get_input_entity . :meth: client.download_media didn't support PhotoSize . Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Less RPC are made when accessing the .sender and .chat of some events (mostly those that occur in a channel). You can send albums larger than 10 items (they will be sliced for you), as well as mixing normal files with photos. TLObject now have Python type hints. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Several documentation corrections. :meth: client.get_dialogs is only called once again when an entity is not found to avoid flood waits.","title":"Iterator methods (v0.18.1)"},{"location":"misc/changelog/#sessions-overhaul-v018","text":"Published at 2018/03/04 +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 75 | +-----------------------+ The Session 's have been revisited thanks to the work of @tulir and they now use an ABC <https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html> __ so you can easily implement your own! The default will still be a SQLiteSession , but you might want to use the new AlchemySessionContainer if you need. Refer to the section of the documentation on :ref: sessions for more. Breaking changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ events.MessageChanged doesn't exist anymore. Use the new events.MessageEdited and events.MessageDeleted instead. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ The mentioned addition of new session types. You can omit the event type on client.add_event_handler to use Raw . You can raise StopPropagation of events if you added several of them. .get_participants() can now get up to 90,000 members from groups with 100,000 if when aggressive=True , \"bypassing\" Telegram's limit. You now can access NewMessage.Event.pattern_match . Multiple captions are now supported when sending albums. client.send_message() has an optional file= parameter, so you can do events.reply(file='/path/to/photo.jpg') and similar. Added .input_ versions to events.ChatAction . You can now access the public .client property on events . New client.forward_messages , with its own wrapper on events , called event.forward_to(...) . Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ Silly bug regarding client.get_me(input_peer=True) . client.send_voice_note() was missing some parameters. client.send_file() plays better with streams now. Incoming messages from bots weren't working with whitelists. Markdown's URL regex was not accepting newlines. Better attempt at joining background update threads. Use the right peer type when a marked integer ID is provided. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Resolving events.Raw is now a no-op. Logging calls in the TcpClient to spot errors. events resolution is postponed until you are successfully connected, so you can attach them before starting the client. When an entity is not found, it is searched in all dialogs. This might not always be desirable but it's more comfortable for legitimate uses.

You can now send b'byte strings' directly as files again. .send_file() was not respecting the original captions when passing another message (or media) as the file. Downloading media from a different data center would always log a warning for the first time. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Use req_pq_multi instead req_pq when generating auth_key . You can use .get_me(input_peer=True) if all you need is your self ID. New addition to the interactive client example to show peer information.

But this update also brings a few more changes! Additions ~~~~~~~~~ TLObject 's override __eq__ and __ne__ , so you can compare them. Added some missing cases on .get_input_entity() and peer functions. obj.to_dict() now has a '_' key with the type used. .start() can also sign up now. More parameters for .get_message_history() . Updated list of RPC errors. HTML parsing thanks to @tulir ! It can be used similar to markdown: client.send_message(..., parse_mode='html') . Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ client.send_file() now accepts Message 's and MessageMedia 's as the file parameter. Some documentation updates and fixed to clarify certain things. New exact match feature on https://tl.telethon.dev . Return as early as possible from .get_input_entity() and similar, to avoid penalizing you for doing this right. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ .download_media() wouldn't accept a Document as parameter. The SQLite is now closed properly on disconnection. IPv6 addresses shouldn't use square braces.

The object now has access to the client , so that it can fetch the right type if needed, or access the session database. Furthermore, you can reuse requests that need \"autocast\" (e.g. you put :tl: User but InputPeer was needed), since .resolve() is called when invoking. Before, it was only done on object construction. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ Album support. Just pass a list, tuple or any iterable to .send_file() . Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ .start() asks for your phone only if required. Better file cache. All files under 10MB, once uploaded, should never be needed to be re-uploaded again, as the sent media is cached to the session. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ setup.py now calls gen_tl when installing the library if needed. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The mentioned .resolve() to perform \"autocast\", more powerful. Upload and download methods are no longer part of TelegramBareClient . Reuse .on_response() , .__str__ and .stringify() . Only override .on_response() if necessary (small amount of cases).

Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ The library uses again only a single connection. Less updates are be dropped now, and the performance is even better than using temporary connections. without rowid will only be used on the *.session if supported.

This proved to be bad as soon as one wanted to add more fields. For this reason, they were migrated to use JSON instead. But this proved to be bad as soon as one wanted to save things like entities (usernames, their ID and hash), so now it properly uses sqlite3 <https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html> __, which has been well tested, to save the session files! Calling .get_input_entity using a username no longer will need to fetch it first, so it's really 0 calls again. Calling .get_entity will always fetch the most up to date version.

Usernames will always be resolved, since they may have changed. .set_proxy() method, to avoid having to create a new TelegramClient . More date types supported to represent a date parameter. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ Empty strings weren't working when they were a flag parameter (e.g., setting no last name). Fix invalid assertion regarding flag parameters as well. Avoid joining the background thread on disconnect, as it would be None due to a race condition. Correctly handle None dates when downloading media. .download_profile_photo was failing for some channels. .download_media wasn't handling Photo . Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ date was being serialized as local date, but that was wrong. date was being represented as a float instead of an int . .tl parser wasn't stripping inline comments. Removed some redundant checks on update_state.py . Use a synchronized queue <https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html> __ instead a hand crafted version.

New .get_drafts() method with a custom Draft class by @JosXa . Join all threads when calling .disconnect() , to assert no dangling thread is left alive. Larger chunk when downloading files should result in faster downloads. You can use a callable key for the EntityDatabase , so it can be any filter you need. .. bug-fixes-3: Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ .get_input_entity was failing for IDs and other cases, also making more requests than it should. Use basename instead abspath when sending a file. You can now also override the attributes.

The EntityDatabase will, by default, cache all the users, chats and channels you find in memory for as long as the program is running. The session will, by default, save all key-value pairs of the entity identifiers and their hashes (since Telegram may send an ID that it thinks you already know about, we need to save this information). You can prevent the EntityDatabase from saving users by setting client.session.entities.enabled = False , and prevent the Session from saving input entities at all by setting client.session.save_entities = False . You can also clear the cache for a certain user through client.session.entities.clear_cache(entity=None) , which will clear all if no entity is given. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ New method to .delete_messages() . New ChannelPrivateError class. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ .sign_in accepts phones as integers. Changing the IP to which you connect to is as simple as client.session.server_address = 'ip' , since now the server address is always queried from the session.

No need to deal with this manually since new connections are now handled on demand by the library itself. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ You can invoke requests from update handlers . And any other thread . A new temporary will be made, so that you can be sending even several requests at the same time! Several worker threads for your updates! By default, None will spawn. I recommend you to work with update_workers=4 to get started, these will be polling constantly for updates. You can also change the number of workers at any given time. The library can now run in a single thread again, if you don't need to spawn any at all. Simply set spawn_read_thread=False when creating the TelegramClient ! You can specify limit=None on .get_dialogs() to get all of them[1]. Updates are expanded , so you don't need to check if the update has .updates or an inner .update anymore. All InputPeer entities are saved in the session file, but you can disable this by setting save_entities=False . New .get_input_entity method, which makes use of the above feature. You should use this when a request needs a InputPeer , rather than the whole entity (although both work). Assert that either all or None dependent-flag parameters are set before sending the request. Phone numbers can have dashes, spaces, or parenthesis. They'll be removed before making the request. You can override the phone and its hash on .sign_in() , if you're creating a new TelegramClient on two different places. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ .log_out() was consuming all retries. It should work just fine now. The session would fail to load if the auth_key had been removed manually. Updates.check_error was popping wrong side, although it's been completely removed. ServerError \\ 's will be ignored , and the request will immediately be retried. Cross-thread safety when saving the session file. Some things changed on a matter of when to reconnect, so please report any bugs! .. internal-changes-2: Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ TelegramClient is now only an abstraction over the TelegramBareClient , which can only do basic things, such as invoking requests, working with files, etc. If you don't need any of the abstractions the TelegramClient , you can now use the TelegramBareClient in a much more comfortable way. MtProtoSender is not thread-safe, but it doesn't need to be since a new connection will be spawned when needed. New connections used to be cached and then reused. Now only their sessions are saved, as temporary connections are spawned only when needed. Added more RPC errors to the list.

The username regex mentioned on UsernameInvalidError was invalid, but it has now been fixed.

You should post these updates to some other thread, and let that thread do the job instead. Invoking a request from within a callback will mean that, while this request is being invoked, no other things will be read. Internally, the generated code now resides under a lot less files, simply for the sake of avoiding so many unnecessary files. The generated code is not meant to be read by anyone, simply to do its job. Unused attributes have been removed from the TLObject class too, and .sign_up() returns the user that just logged in in a similar way to .sign_in() now.","title":"Invoke other requests from within update callbacks (v0.13.1)"},{"location":"misc/changelog/#connection-modes-v013","text":"Published at 2017/09/04 +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 71 | +-----------------------+ The purpose of this release is to denote a big change, now you can connect to Telegram through different **connection modes** <https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/blob/v0.13/telethon/network/connection.py> __. Also, a second thread will always be started when you connect a TelegramClient , despite whether you'll be handling updates or ignoring them, whose sole purpose is to constantly read from the network. The reason for this change is as simple as \"reading and writing shouldn't be related\" . Even when you're simply ignoring updates, this way, once you send a request you will only need to read the result for the request. Whatever Telegram sent before has already been read and outside the buffer. .. additions-2: Additions ~~~~~~~~~ The mentioned different connection modes, and a new thread. You can modify the Session attributes through the TelegramClient constructor (using **kwargs ). RPCError \\ 's now belong to some request you've made, which makes more sense. get_input_* now handles None (default) parameters more gracefully (it used to crash). .. enhancements-4: Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ The low-level socket doesn't use a handcrafted timeout anymore, which should benefit by avoiding the arbitrary sleep(0.1) that there used to be. TelegramClient.sign_in will call .send_code_request if no code was provided. Deprecation ~~~~~~~~~~~ .sign_up does not take a phone argument anymore. Change this or you will be using phone as code , and it will fail! The definition looks like def sign_up(self, code, first_name, last_name='') . The old JsonSession finally replaces the original Session (which used pickle).

Telegram sends their sha256 sum for clients to implement this additional verification step, which now the library has. If any CDN has altered the file you're trying to download, CdnFileTamperedError will be raised to let you know. Besides this. TLObject.stringify() was showing bytes as lists (now fixed) and RPC errors are reported by default: In an attempt to help everyone who works with the Telegram API, Telethon will by default report all Remote Procedure Call errors to `PWRTelegram <https://pwrtelegram.xyz/>`__, a public database anyone can query, made by `Daniil <https://github.com/danog>`__. All the information sent is a GET request with the error code, error message and method used. .. note:: If you still would like to opt out, simply set ``client.session.report_errors = False`` to disable this feature.

The .sign_in() method didn't support integer values for the code! Now it does again. Some important internal changes are that the old way to deal with RSA public keys now uses a different module instead the old strange hand-crafted version.

Breaking changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The TelegramClient methods .send_photo_file() , .send_document_file() and .send_media_file() are now a single method called .send_file() . It's also important to note that the order of the parameters has been swapped : first to who you want to send it, then the file itself. The same applies to .download_msg_media() , which has been renamed to .download_media() . The method now supports a Message itself too, rather than only Message.media . The specialized .download_photo() , .download_document() and .download_contact() still exist, but are private. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ Updated to layer 70 ! Both downloading and uploading now support stream-like objects . A lot faster initial connection if sympy is installed (can be installed through pip ). libssl will also be used if available on your system (likely on Linux based systems). This speed boost should also apply to uploading and downloading files. You can use a phone number or an username for methods like .send_message() , .send_file() , and all the other quick-access methods provided by the TelegramClient . .. bug-fixes-5: Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ Crashing when migrating to a new layer and receiving old updates should not happen now. InputPeerChannel is now casted to InputChannel automtically too. .get_new_msg_id() should now be thread-safe. No promises. Logging out on macOS caused a crash, which should be gone now. More checks to ensure that the connection is flagged correctly as either connected or not. .. note:: Downloading files from CDN's will not work yet (something new that comes with layer 70). That's it, any new idea or suggestion about how to make the project even more friendly is highly appreciated. .. note:: Did you know that you can pretty print any result Telegram returns (called ``TLObject``\\ 's) by using their ``.stringify()`` function?

Code without errors doesn't work \u00b6 Then it probably has errors, but you haven't enabled logging yet. To enable logging, at the following code to the top of your main file: import logging logging . basicConfig ( format = '[ %(levelname) 5s / %(asctime)s ] %(name)s : %(message)s ' , level = logging . WARNING ) You can change the logging level to be something different, from less to more information: level = logging . CRITICAL # won't show errors (same as disabled) level = logging . ERROR # will only show errors that you didn't handle level = logging . WARNING # will also show messages with medium severity, such as internal Telegram issues level = logging . INFO # will also show informational messages, such as connection or disconnections level = logging . DEBUG # will show a lot of output to help debugging issues in the library See the official Python documentation for more information on logging_. How can I except FloodWaitError? \u00b6 You can use all errors from the API by importing: from telethon import errors And except them as such: try : await client . send_message ( chat , 'Hi' ) except errors . FloodWaitError as e : # e.seconds is how many seconds you have # to wait before making the request again. print ( 'Flood for' , e . seconds ) My account was deleted/limited when using the library \u00b6 The library will only do things that you tell it to do. If you use the library with bad intentions, Telegram will hopefully ban you. However, you may also be part of a limited country, such as Iran or Russia. In that case, we have bad news for you. Telegram is much more likely to ban these numbers, as they are often used to spam other accounts, likely through the use of libraries like this one. The best advice we can give you is to not abuse the API, like calling many requests really quickly, and to sign up with these phones through an official application. We have also had reports from Kazakhstan and China, where connecting would fail. To solve these connection problems, you should use a proxy. Telegram may also ban virtual (VoIP) phone numbers, as again, they're likely to be used for spam. If you want to check if your account has been limited, simply send a private message to @SpamBot through Telegram itself. You should notice this by getting errors like PeerFloodError , which means you're limited, for instance, when sending a message to some accounts but not others. For more discussion, please see issue 297 . How can I use a proxy? \u00b6 This was one of the first things described in :ref: signing-in . How do I access a field? \u00b6 This is basic Python knowledge. You should use the dot operator: me = await client . get_me () print ( me . username ) # ^ we used the dot operator to access the username attribute result = await client ( functions . photos . GetUserPhotosRequest ( user_id = 'me' , offset = 0 , max_id = 0 , limit = 100 )) # Working with list is also pretty basic print ( result . photos [ 0 ] . sizes [ - 1 ] . type ) # ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ # | | | | \\ type # | | | \\ last size # | | \\ list of sizes # access | \\ first photo from the list # the... \\ list of photos # # To print all, you could do (or mix-and-match): for photo in result . photos : for size in photo . sizes : print ( size . type ) AttributeError: 'coroutine' object has no attribute 'id' \u00b6 You either forgot to: import telethon.sync # ^^^^^ import sync Or: async def handler ( event ): me = await client . get_me () # ^^^^^ note the await print ( me . username ) sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked \u00b6 An older process is still running and is using the same 'session' file. This error occurs when two or more clients use the same session , that is, when you write the same session name to be used in the client: You have an older process using the same session file. You have two different scripts running (interactive sessions count too). You have two clients in the same script running at the same time. The solution is, if you need two clients, use two sessions. If the problem persists and you're on Linux, you can use fuser my.session to find out the process locking the file. As a last resort, you can reboot your system. If you really dislike SQLite, use a different session storage. There is an entire section covering that at :ref: sessions . event.chat or event.sender is None \u00b6 Telegram doesn't always send this information in order to save bandwidth. If you need the information, you should fetch it yourself, since the library won't do unnecessary work unless you need to: async def handler ( event ): chat = await event . get_chat () sender = await event . get_sender () What does bases ChatGetter mean? \u00b6 In Python, classes can base others. This is called inheritance <https://ddg.gg/python%20inheritance> _. What it means is that \"if a class bases another, you can use the other's methods too\". For example, Message <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message> bases ChatGetter <telethon.tl.custom.chatgetter.ChatGetter> . In turn, ChatGetter <telethon.tl.custom.chatgetter.ChatGetter> defines things like obj.chat_id <telethon.tl.custom.chatgetter.ChatGetter> . So if you have a message, you can access that too: # ChatGetter has a chat_id property, and Message bases ChatGetter. # Thus you can use ChatGetter properties and methods from Message print ( message . chat_id ) Telegram has a lot to offer, and inheritance helps the library reduce boilerplate, so it's important to know this concept. For newcomers, this may be a problem, so we explain what it means here in the FAQ. Can I use Flask with the library? \u00b6 Yes, if you know what you are doing. However, you will probably have a lot of headaches to get threads and asyncio to work together. Instead, consider using Quart , an asyncio-based alternative to Flask . Check out quart_login.py for an example web-application based on Quart. Can I use Anaconda/Spyder/IPython with the library? \u00b6 Yes, but these interpreters run the asyncio event loop implicitly, which interferes with the telethon.sync magic module. If you use them, you should not import sync : # Change any of these...: from telethon import TelegramClient , sync , ... from telethon.sync import TelegramClient , ... # ...with this: from telethon import TelegramClient , ... You are also more likely to get \"sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked\" with them. If they cause too much trouble, just write your code in a .py file and run that, or use the normal python interpreter.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"quick-references/faq/#faq","text":"Let's start the quick references section with some useful tips to keep in mind, with the hope that you will understand why certain things work the way that they do.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"quick-references/faq/#code-without-errors-doesnt-work","text":"Then it probably has errors, but you haven't enabled logging yet.
