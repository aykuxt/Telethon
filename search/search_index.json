Once you have Python installed, run: pip3 install -U telethon --user To install or upgrade the library to the latest version. Installing Development Versions \u00b6 If you want the latest unreleased changes, you can run the following command instead: pip3 install -U https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/archive/master.zip --user Note The development version may have bugs and is not recommended for production use. However, when you are reporting a library bug , you should try if the bug still occurs in this version. Verification \u00b6 To verify that the library is installed correctly, run the following command: python3 -c \"import telethon; print(telethon.__version__)\" The version number of the library should show in the output. Optional Dependencies \u00b6 If cryptg is installed, the library will work a lot faster , since encryption and decryption will be made in C instead of Python. If your code deals with a lot of updates or you are downloading/uploading a lot of files, you will notice a considerable speed-up (from a hundred kilobytes per second to several megabytes per second, if your connection allows it). If it's not installed, pyaes will be used (which is pure Python, so it's much slower). If pillow is installed, large images will be automatically resized when sending photos to prevent Telegram from failing with \"invalid image\". Official clients also do this. If aiohttp is installed, the library will be able to download WebDocument media files (otherwise you will get an error). If hachoir is installed, it will be used to extract metadata from files when sending documents. Telegram uses this information to show the song's performer, artist, title, duration, and for videos too (including size). Otherwise, they will default to empty values, and you can set the attributes manually. Note Some of the modules may require additional dependencies before being installed through pip . If you have an apt -based system, consider installing the most commonly missing dependencies: apt update apt install clang lib { jpeg-turbo,webp } -dev python { ,-dev } zlib-dev pip install -U --user setuptools pip install -U --user telethon cryptg pillow Thanks to @bb010g for writing down this nice list.","title":"Installation"},{"location":"basic/installation/#installation","text":"Telethon is a Python library, which means you need to download and install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/ if you haven't already.

Click under API Development tools. A Create new application window will appear. Fill in your application details. There is no need to enter any URL , and only the first two fields ( App title and Short name ) can currently be changed later. Click on Create application at the end. Remember that your API hash is secret and Telegram won't let you revoke it. Don't post it anywhere! Note This API ID and hash is the one used by your application , not your phone number. You can use this API ID and hash with any phone number or even for bot accounts. Editing the Code \u00b6 This is a little introduction for those new to Python programming in general. We will write our code inside hello.py , so you can use any text editor that you like. To run the code, use python3 hello.py from the terminal. Important Don't call your script telethon.py ! Python will try to import the client from there and it will fail with an error such as ImportError: cannot import name 'TelegramClient' ... . Signing In \u00b6 We can finally write some code to log into our account! from telethon import TelegramClient # Use your own values from my.telegram.org api_id = 12345 api_hash = '0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef' # The first parameter is the .session file name (absolute paths allowed) with TelegramClient ( 'anon' , api_id , api_hash ) as client : client . loop . run_until_complete ( client . send_message ( 'me' , 'Hello, myself!' )) In the first line, we import the class name so we can create an instance of the client. Then, we define variables to store our API ID and hash conveniently. At last, we create a new TelegramClient <telethon.client.telegramclient.TelegramClient> instance and call it client . We can now use the client variable for anything that we want, such as sending a message to ourselves. Note Since Telethon is an asynchronous library, you need to await coroutine functions to have them run (or otherwise, run the loop until they are complete). In this tiny example, we don't bother making an async def main() . See :ref: mastering-asyncio to find out more. Using a with block is the preferred way to use the library. It will automatically start() <telethon.client.auth.AuthMethods.start> the client, logging or signing up if necessary. If the .session file already existed, it will not login again, so be aware of this if you move or rename the file! Signing In as a Bot Account \u00b6 You can also use Telethon for your bots (normal bot accounts, not users). You will still need an API ID and hash, but the process is very similar: from telethon.sync import TelegramClient api_id = 12345 api_hash = '0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef' bot_token = '12345:0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef' # We have to manually call \"start\" if we want an explicit bot token bot = TelegramClient ( 'bot' , api_id , api_hash ) . start ( bot_token = bot_token ) # But then we can use the client instance as usual with bot : ... To get a bot account, you need to talk with @BotFather . Signing In behind a Proxy \u00b6 If you need to use a proxy to access Telegram, you will need to install PySocks and then change: TelegramClient ( 'anon' , api_id , api_hash ) with TelegramClient ( 'anon' , api_id , api_hash , proxy = ( socks . SOCKS5 , '127.0.0.1' , 4444 )) (of course, replacing the IP and port with the IP and port of the proxy). The proxy= argument should be a tuple, a list or a dict, consisting of parameters described in PySocks usage . Using MTProto Proxies \u00b6 MTProto Proxies are Telegram's alternative to normal proxies, and work a bit differently. The following protocols are available: ConnectionTcpMTProxyAbridged ConnectionTcpMTProxyIntermediate ConnectionTcpMTProxyRandomizedIntermediate (preferred) For now, you need to manually specify these special connection modes if you want to use a MTProto Proxy. Your code would look like this: from telethon import TelegramClient , connection # we need to change the connection ^^^^^^^^^^ client = TelegramClient ( 'anon' , api_id , api_hash , # Use one of the available connection modes. # Normally, this one works with most proxies. connection = connection . ConnectionTcpMTProxyRandomizedIntermediate , # Then, pass the proxy details as a tuple: # (host name, port, proxy secret) # # If the proxy has no secret, the secret must be: # '00000000000000000000000000000000' proxy = ( 'mtproxy.example.com' , 2002 , 'secret' ) ) In future updates, we may make it easier to use MTProto Proxies (such as avoiding the need to manually pass connection= ).

After all, you want to be notified when a new message arrives, when a member joins, when someone starts typing, etc. For that, you can use events . Important It is strongly advised to enable logging when working with events, since exceptions in event handlers are hidden by default. Please add the following snippet to the very top of your file: import logging logging . basicConfig ( format = '[ %(levelname) 5s / %(asctime)s ] %(name)s : %(message)s ' , level = logging . WARNING ) Getting Started \u00b6 Let's start things with an example to automate replies: from telethon import TelegramClient , events client = TelegramClient ( 'anon' , api_id , api_hash ) @client . on ( events . NewMessage ) async def my_event_handler ( event ): if 'hello' in event . raw_text : await event . reply ( 'hi!' ) client . start () client . run_until_disconnected () This code isn't much, but there might be some things unclear. Let's break it down: from telethon import TelegramClient , events client = TelegramClient ( 'anon' , api_id , api_hash ) This is normal creation (of course, pass session name, API ID and hash). Nothing we don't know already. @client . on ( events . NewMessage ) This Python decorator will attach itself to the my_event_handler definition, and basically means that on a NewMessage <telethon.events.newmessage.NewMessage> event , the callback function you're about to define will be called: async def my_event_handler ( event ): if 'hello' in event . raw_text : await event . reply ( 'hi!' ) If a NewMessage <telethon.events.newmessage.NewMessage> event occurs, and 'hello' is in the text of the message, we reply() <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.reply> to the event with a 'hi!' message. Note Event handlers must be async def . After all, Telethon is an asynchronous library based on asyncio , which is a safer and often faster approach to threads. You must await all method calls that use network requests, which is most of them. More Examples \u00b6 Replying to messages with hello is fun, but, can we do more? @client . on ( events . NewMessage ( outgoing = True , pattern = r '\\.save' )) async def handler ( event ): if event . is_reply : replied = await event . get_reply_message () sender = replied . sender await client . download_profile_photo ( sender ) await event . respond ( 'Saved your photo {} ' . format ( sender . username )) We could also get replies. This event filters outgoing messages (only those that we send will trigger the method), then we filter by the regex r'\\.save' , which will match messages starting with \".save\" . Inside the method, we check whether the event is replying to another message or not. If it is, we get the reply message and the sender of that message, and download their profile photo. Let's delete messages which contain \"heck\". We don't allow swearing here. @client . on ( events . NewMessage ( pattern = r '(?i).*heck' )) async def handler ( event ): await event . delete () With the r'(?i).*heck' regex, we match case-insensitive \"heck\" anywhere in the message. Regex is very powerful and you can learn more at https://regexone.com/ . So far, we have only seen the NewMessage <telethon.events.newmessage.NewMessage> , but there are many more which will be covered later. This is only a small introduction to updates. Entities \u00b6 When you need the user or chat where an event occurred, you must use the following methods: async def handler ( event ): # Good chat = await event . get_chat () sender = await event . get_sender () chat_id = event . chat_id sender_id = event . sender_id # BAD. Don't do this chat = event . chat sender = event . sender chat_id = event . chat . id sender_id = event . sender . id Events are like messages, but don't have all the information a message has! When you manually get a message, it will have all the information it needs. When you receive an update about a message, it won't have all the information, so you have to use the methods , not the properties. Make sure you understand the code seen here before continuing! As a rule of thumb, remember that new message events behave just like message objects, so you can do with them everything you can do with a message object.","title":"Updates"},{"location":"basic/updates/#updates","text":"Updates are an important topic in a messaging platform like Telegram.

WARNING )","title":"Updates"},{"location":"basic/updates/#getting-started","text":"Let's start things with an example to automate replies: from telethon import TelegramClient , events client = TelegramClient ( 'anon' , api_id , api_hash ) @client . on ( events . NewMessage ) async def my_event_handler ( event ): if 'hello' in event . raw_text : await event . reply ( 'hi!' ) client . start () client . run_until_disconnected () This code isn't much, but there might be some things unclear. Let's break it down: from telethon import TelegramClient , events client = TelegramClient ( 'anon' , api_id , api_hash ) This is normal creation (of course, pass session name, API ID and hash). Nothing we don't know already. @client . on ( events . NewMessage ) This Python decorator will attach itself to the my_event_handler definition, and basically means that on a NewMessage <telethon.events.newmessage.NewMessage> event , the callback function you're about to define will be called: async def my_event_handler ( event ): if 'hello' in event . raw_text : await event . reply ( 'hi!' ) If a NewMessage <telethon.events.newmessage.NewMessage> event occurs, and 'hello' is in the text of the message, we reply() <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.reply> to the event with a 'hi!' message. Note Event handlers must be async def . After all, Telethon is an asynchronous library based on asyncio , which is a safer and often faster approach to threads. You must await all method calls that use network requests, which is most of them.","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"basic/updates/#more-examples","text":"Replying to messages with hello is fun, but, can we do more? @client . on ( events .

This event filters outgoing messages (only those that we send will trigger the method), then we filter by the regex r'\\.save' , which will match messages starting with \".save\" . Inside the method, we check whether the event is replying to another message or not. If it is, we get the reply message and the sender of that message, and download their profile photo. Let's delete messages which contain \"heck\". We don't allow swearing here. @client . on ( events . NewMessage ( pattern = r '(?i).*heck' )) async def handler ( event ): await event . delete () With the r'(?i).*heck' regex, we match case-insensitive \"heck\" anywhere in the message. Regex is very powerful and you can learn more at https://regexone.com/ .

Don't do this chat = event . chat sender = event . sender chat_id = event . chat . id sender_id = event . sender . id Events are like messages, but don't have all the information a message has! When you manually get a message, it will have all the information it needs. When you receive an update about a message, it won't have all the information, so you have to use the methods , not the properties. Make sure you understand the code seen here before continuing! As a rule of thumb, remember that new message events behave just like message objects, so you can do with them everything you can do with a message object.","title":"Entities"},{"location":"concepts/asyncio/","text":"Mastering asyncio \u00b6 What's asyncio? \u00b6 asyncio is a Python 3's built-in library. This means it's already installed if you have Python 3. Since Python 3.5, it is convenient to work with asynchronous code. Before (Python 3.4) we didn't have async or await , but now we do. asyncio stands for Asynchronous Input Output . This is a very powerful concept to use whenever you work IO. Interacting with the web or external APIs such as Telegram's makes a lot of sense this way. Why asyncio? \u00b6 Asynchronous IO makes a lot of sense in a library like Telethon. You send a request to the server (such as \"get some message\"), and thanks to asyncio , your code won't block while a response arrives. The alternative would be to spawn a thread for each update so that other code can run while the response arrives. That is a lot more expensive. The code will also run faster, because instead of switching back and forth between the OS and your script, your script can handle it all. Avoiding switching saves quite a bit of time, in Python or any other language that supports asynchronous IO. It will also be cheaper, because tasks are smaller than threads, which are smaller than processes. What are asyncio basics? \u00b6 # First we need the asyncio library import asyncio # Then we need a loop to work with loop = asyncio . get_event_loop () # We also need something to run async def main (): for char in 'Hello, world! \\n ' : print ( char , end = '' , flush = True ) await asyncio . sleep ( 0.2 ) # Then, we need to run the loop with a task loop . run_until_complete ( main ()) What does telethon.sync do? \u00b6 The moment you import any of these: from telethon import sync , ... # or from telethon.sync import ... # or import telethon.sync The sync module rewrites most async def methods in Telethon to something similar to this: def new_method (): result = original_method () if loop . is_running (): # the loop is already running, return the await-able to the user return result else : # the loop is not running yet, so we can run it for the user return loop . run_until_complete ( result ) That means you can do this: print ( client . get_me () . username ) Instead of this: me = client . loop . run_until_complete ( client . get_me ()) print ( me . username ) # or, using asyncio's default loop (it's the same) import asyncio loop = asyncio . get_event_loop () # == client.loop me = loop . run_until_complete ( client . get_me ()) print ( me . username ) As you can see, it's a lot of boilerplate and noise having to type run_until_complete all the time, so you can let the magic module to rewrite it for you. But notice the comment above: it won't run the loop if it's already running, because it can't. That means this: async def main (): # 3. the loop is running here print ( client . get_me () # 4. this will return a coroutine! . username # 5. this fails, coroutines don't have usernames ) loop . run_until_complete ( # 2. run the loop and the ``main()`` coroutine main () # 1. calling ``async def`` \"returns\" a coroutine ) Will fail. So if you're inside an async def , then the loop is running, and if the loop is running, you must await things yourself: async def main (): print (( await client . get_me ()) . username ) loop . run_until_complete ( main ()) What are async, await and coroutines? \u00b6 The async keyword lets you define asynchronous functions, also known as coroutines, and also iterate over asynchronous loops or use async with : import asyncio async def main (): # ^ this declares the main() coroutine function async with client : # ^ this is an asynchronous with block async for message in client . iter_messages ( chat ): # ^ this is a for loop over an asynchronous generator print ( message . sender . username ) loop = asyncio . get_event_loop () # ^ this assigns the default event loop from the main thread to a variable loop . run_until_complete ( main ()) # ^ this runs the *entire* loop until the main() function finishes. # While the main() function does not finish, the loop will be running. # While the loop is running, you can't run it again. The await keyword blocks the current task, and the loop can run other tasks. Tasks can be thought of as \"threads\", since many can run concurrently: import asyncio async def hello ( delay ): await asyncio . sleep ( delay ) # await tells the loop this task is \"busy\" print ( 'hello' ) # eventually the loop resumes the code here async def world ( delay ): # the loop decides this method should run first await asyncio . sleep ( delay ) # await tells the loop this task is \"busy\" print ( 'world' ) # eventually the loop finishes all tasks loop = asyncio . get_event_loop () # get the default loop for the main thread loop . create_task ( world ( 2 )) # create the world task, passing 2 as delay loop . create_task ( hello ( delay = 1 )) # another task, but with delay 1 try : # run the event loop forever; ctrl+c to stop it # we could also run the loop for three seconds: # loop.run_until_complete(asyncio.sleep(3)) loop . run_forever () except KeyboardInterrupt : pass The same example, but without the comment noise: import asyncio async def hello ( delay ): await asyncio . sleep ( delay ) print ( 'hello' ) async def world ( delay ): await asyncio . sleep ( delay ) print ( 'world' ) loop = asyncio . get_event_loop () loop . create_task ( world ( 2 )) loop . create_task ( hello ( 1 )) loop . run_until_complete ( asyncio . sleep ( 3 )) Can I use threads? \u00b6 Yes, you can, but you must understand that the loops themselves are not thread safe. and you must be sure to know what is happening. You may want to create a loop in a new thread and make sure to pass it to the client: import asyncio import threading def go (): loop = asyncio . new_event_loop () client = TelegramClient ( ... , loop = loop ) ... threading . Thread ( target = go ) . start () Generally, you don't need threads unless you know what you're doing. Just create another task, as shown above. If you're using the Telethon with a library that uses threads, you must be careful to use threading.Lock whenever you use the client, or enable the compatible mode. For that, see Compatibility and Convenience . You may have seen this error: RuntimeError: There is no current event loop in thread 'Thread-1'. It just means you didn't create a loop for that thread, and if you don't pass a loop when creating the client, it uses asyncio.get_event_loop() , which only works in the main thread. client.run_until_disconnected() blocks! \u00b6 All of what client.run_until_disconnected() <telethon.client.updates.UpdateMethods.run_until_disconnected> does is run the asyncio 's event loop until the client is disconnected. That means the loop is running . And if the loop is running, it will run all the tasks in it. So if you want to run other code, create tasks for it: from datetime import datetime async def clock (): while True : print ( 'The time:' , datetime . now ()) await asyncio . sleep ( 1 ) loop . create_task ( clock ()) ... client . run_until_disconnected () This creates a task for a clock that prints the time every second. You don't need to use client.run_until_disconnected() <telethon.client.updates.UpdateMethods.run_until_disconnected> either! You just need to make the loop is running, somehow. loop.run_forever() <asyncio.loop.run_forever()> and loop.run_until_complete() <asyncio.loop.run_until_complete> can also be used to run the loop, and Telethon will be happy with any approach. Of course, there are better tools to run code hourly or daily, see below. What else can asyncio do? \u00b6 Asynchronous IO is a really powerful tool, as we've seen. There are plenty of other useful libraries that also use asyncio and that you can integrate with Telethon. aiohttp is like the infamous requests but asynchronous. quart is an asynchronous alternative to Flask . aiocron lets you schedule things to run things at a desired time, or run some tasks hourly, daily, etc. And of course, asyncio itself! It has a lot of methods that let you do nice things. For example, you can run requests in parallel: async def main (): last , sent , download_path = await asyncio . gather ( client . get_messages ( 'TelethonChat' , 10 ), client . send_message ( 'TelethonOfftopic' , 'Hey guys!' ), client . download_profile_photo ( 'TelethonChat' ) ) loop . run_until_complete ( main ()) This code will get the 10 last messages from @TelethonChat , send one to @TelethonOfftopic , and also download the profile photo of the main group. asyncio will run all these three tasks at the same time. You can run all the tasks you want this way. A different way would be: loop . create_task ( client . get_messages ( 'TelethonChat' , 10 )) loop . create_task ( client . send_message ( 'TelethonOfftopic' , 'Hey guys!' )) loop . create_task ( client . download_profile_photo ( 'TelethonChat' )) They will run in the background as long as the loop is running too. You can also start an asyncio server in the main script, and from another script, connect to it to achieve Inter-Process Communication . You can get as creative as you want. You can program anything you want. When you use a library, you're not limited to use only its methods. You can combine all the libraries you want. People seem to forget this simple fact! Why does client.start() work outside async? \u00b6 Because it's so common that it's really convenient to offer said functionality by default. This means you can set up all your event handlers and start the client without worrying about loops at all. Using the client in a with block, start <telethon.client.auth.AuthMethods.start> , run_until_disconnected <telethon.client.updates.UpdateMethods.run_until_disconnected> , and disconnect <telethon.client.telegrambaseclient.TelegramBaseClient.disconnect> all support this. Where can I read more? \u00b6 Check out my blog post about asyncio , which has some more examples and pictures to help you understand what happens when the loop runs.","title":"Mastering asyncio"},{"location":"concepts/asyncio/#mastering-asyncio","text":"","title":"Mastering asyncio"},{"location":"concepts/asyncio/#whats-asyncio","text":"asyncio is a Python 3's built-in library.

If you haven't decided which wrapper library for bots to use yet, using Telethon from the beginning may save you some headaches later. What is Bot API? \u00b6 The Telegram Bot API , also known as HTTP Bot API and from now on referred to as simply \"Bot API\" is Telegram's official way for developers to control their own Telegram bots. Quoting their main page: The Bot API is an HTTP-based interface created for developers keen on building bots for Telegram. To learn how to create and set up a bot, please consult our Introduction to Bots and Bot FAQ . Bot API is simply an HTTP endpoint which translates your requests to it into MTProto calls through tdlib , their bot backend. What is MTProto? \u00b6 MTProto is Telegram's own protocol to communicate with their API when you connect to their servers. Telethon is an alternative MTProto-based backend written entirely in Python and much easier to setup and use. Both official applications and third-party clients (like your own applications) logged in as either user or bots can use MTProto to communicate directly with Telegram's API (which is not the HTTP bot API). When we talk about MTProto, we often mean \"MTProto-based clients\". Advantages of MTProto over Bot API \u00b6 MTProto clients (like Telethon) connect directly to Telegram's servers, which means there is no HTTP connection, no \"polling\" or \"web hooks\". This means less overhead , since the protocol used between you and the server is much more compact than HTTP requests with responses in wasteful JSON. Since there is a direct connection to Telegram's servers, even if their Bot API endpoint is down, you can still have connection to Telegram directly. Using a MTProto client, you are also not limited to the public API that they expose, and instead, you have full control of what your bot can do. Telethon offers you all the power with often much easier usage than any of the available Python Bot API wrappers. If your application ever needs user features because bots cannot do certain things, you will be able to easily login as a user and even keep your bot without having to learn a new library. If less overhead and full control didn't convince you to use Telethon yet, check out the wiki page MTProto vs HTTP Bot API with a more exhaustive and up-to-date list of differences. Migrating from Bot API to Telethon \u00b6 It doesn't matter if you wrote your bot with requests_ and you were making API requests manually, or if you used a wrapper library like python-telegram-bot or pyTelegramBotAPI . It's never too late to migrate to Telethon! If you were using an asynchronous library like aiohttp or a wrapper like aiogram or dumbot , it will be even easier, because Telethon is also an asynchronous library. Next, we will see some examples from the most popular libraries. Migrating from python-telegram-bot \u00b6 Let's take their echobot2.py example and shorten it a bit: from telegram.ext import Updater , CommandHandler , MessageHandler , Filters def start ( update , context ): \"\"\"Send a message when the command /start is issued.\"\"\" update . message . reply_text ( 'Hi!' ) def echo ( update , context ): \"\"\"Echo the user message.\"\"\" update . message . reply_text ( update . message . text ) def main (): \"\"\"Start the bot.\"\"\" updater = Updater ( \"TOKEN\" ) dp = updater . dispatcher dp . add_handler ( CommandHandler ( \"start\" , start )) dp . add_handler ( MessageHandler ( Filters . text , echo )) updater . start_polling () updater . idle () if __name__ == '__main__' : main () After using Telethon: from telethon import TelegramClient , events bot = TelegramClient ( 'bot' , 11111 , 'a1b2c3d4' ) . start ( bot_token = 'TOKEN' ) @bot . on ( events . NewMessage ( pattern = '/start' )) async def start ( event ): \"\"\"Send a message when the command /start is issued.\"\"\" await event . respond ( 'Hi!' ) raise events . StopPropagation @bot . on ( events . NewMessage ) async def echo ( event ): \"\"\"Echo the user message.\"\"\" await event . respond ( event . text ) def main (): \"\"\"Start the bot.\"\"\" bot . run_until_disconnected () if __name__ == '__main__' : main () Key differences: The recommended way to do it imports less things. All handlers trigger by default, so we need events.StopPropagation . Adding handlers, responding and running is a lot less verbose. Telethon needs async def and await . The bot isn't hidden away by Updater or Dispatcher . Migrating from pyTelegramBotAPI \u00b6 Let's show another echobot from their README: import telebot bot = telebot . TeleBot ( \"TOKEN\" ) @bot . message_handler ( commands = [ 'start' ]) def send_welcome ( message ): bot . reply_to ( message , \"Howdy, how are you doing?\" ) @bot . message_handler ( func = lambda m : True ) def echo_all ( message ): bot . reply_to ( message , message . text ) bot . polling () Now we rewrite it to use Telethon: from telethon import TelegramClient , events bot = TelegramClient ( 'bot' , 11111 , 'a1b2c3d4' ) . start ( bot_token = 'TOKEN' ) @bot . on ( events . NewMessage ( pattern = '/start' )) async def send_welcome ( event ): await event . reply ( 'Howdy, how are you doing?' ) @bot . on ( events . NewMessage ) async def echo_all ( event ): await event . reply ( event . text ) bot . run_until_disconnected () Key differences: Instead of doing bot.reply_to(message) , we can do event.reply . Note that the event behaves just like their message . Telethon also supports func=lambda m: True , but it's not necessary. Migrating from aiogram \u00b6 From their GitHub: from aiogram import Bot , Dispatcher , executor , types API_TOKEN = 'BOT TOKEN HERE' # Initialize bot and dispatcher bot = Bot ( token = API_TOKEN ) dp = Dispatcher ( bot ) @dp . message_handler ( commands = [ 'start' ]) async def send_welcome ( message : types . Message ): \"\"\" This handler will be called when client send `/start` command. \"\"\" await message . reply ( \"Hi! \\n I'm EchoBot! \\n Powered by aiogram.\" ) @dp . message_handler ( regexp = '(^cat[s]?$|puss)' ) async def cats ( message : types . Message ): with open ( 'data/cats.jpg' , 'rb' ) as photo : await bot . send_photo ( message . chat . id , photo , caption = 'Cats is here \ud83d\ude3a' , reply_to_message_id = message . message_id ) @dp . message_handler () async def echo ( message : types . Message ): await bot . send_message ( message . chat . id , message . text ) if __name__ == '__main__' : executor . start_polling ( dp , skip_updates = True ) After rewrite: from telethon import TelegramClient , events # Initialize bot and... just the bot! bot = TelegramClient ( 'bot' , 11111 , 'a1b2c3d4' ) . start ( bot_token = 'TOKEN' ) @bot . on ( events .

Since there is a direct connection to Telegram's servers, even if their Bot API endpoint is down, you can still have connection to Telegram directly. Using a MTProto client, you are also not limited to the public API that they expose, and instead, you have full control of what your bot can do. Telethon offers you all the power with often much easier usage than any of the available Python Bot API wrappers. If your application ever needs user features because bots cannot do certain things, you will be able to easily login as a user and even keep your bot without having to learn a new library.

An entity will refer to any :tl: User , :tl: Chat or :tl: Channel object that the API may return in response to certain methods, such as :tl: GetUsersRequest . Note When something \"entity-like\" is required, it means that you need to provide something that can be turned into an entity. These things include, but are not limited to, usernames, exact titles, IDs, :tl: Peer objects, or even entire :tl: User , :tl: Chat and :tl: Channel objects and even phone numbers from people you have in your contact list . To \"encounter\" an ID, you would have to \"find it\" like you would in the normal app. If the peer is in your dialogs, you would need to client.get_dialogs() <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.get_dialogs> . If the peer is someone in a group, you would similarly client.get_participants(group) <telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.get_participants> . Once you have encountered an ID, the library will (by default) have saved their access_hash for you, which is needed to invoke most methods. This is why sometimes you might encounter this error when working with the library. You should except ValueError and run code that you know should work to find the entity. What is an Entity? \u00b6 A lot of methods and requests require entities to work. For example, you send a message to an entity , get the username of an entity , and so on. There are a lot of things that work as entities: usernames, phone numbers, chat links, invite links, IDs, and the types themselves. That is, you can use any of those when you see an \"entity\" is needed. Note Remember that the phone number must be in your contact list before you can use it. You should use, from better to worse : Input entities. For example, event.input_chat <telethon.tl.custom.chatgetter.ChatGetter.input_chat> , message.input_sender <telethon.tl.custom.sendergetter.SenderGetter.input_sender> , or caching an entity you will use a lot with entity = await client.get_input_entity(...) . Entities. For example, if you had to get someone's username, you can just use user or channel . It will work. Only use this option if you already have the entity! IDs. This will always look the entity up from the cache (the *.session file caches seen entities). Usernames, phone numbers and links. The cache will be used too (unless you force a client.get_entity() <telethon.client.users.UserMethods.get_entity> ), but may make a request if the username, phone or link has not been found yet. In recent versions of the library, the following two are equivalent: async def handler ( event ): await client . send_message ( event . sender_id , 'Hi' ) await client . send_message ( event . input_sender , 'Hi' ) If you need to be 99% sure that the code will work (sometimes it's simply impossible for the library to find the input entity), or if you will reuse the chat a lot, consider using the following instead: async def handler ( event ): # This method may make a network request to find the input sender. # Properties can't make network requests, so we need a method. sender = await event . get_input_sender () await client . send_message ( sender , 'Hi' ) await client . send_message ( sender , 'Hi' ) Getting Entities \u00b6 Through the use of the :ref: sessions , the library will automatically remember the ID and hash pair, along with some extra information, so you're able to just do this: # (These examples assume you are inside an \"async def\") # # Dialogs are the \"conversations you have open\". # This method returns a list of Dialog, which # has the .entity attribute and other information. # # This part is IMPORTANT, because it fills the entity cache. dialogs = await client . get_dialogs () # All of these work and do the same. username = await client . get_entity ( 'username' ) username = await client . get_entity ( 't.me/username' ) username = await client . get_entity ( 'https://telegram.dog/username' ) # Other kind of entities. channel = await client . get_entity ( 'telegram.me/joinchat/AAAAAEkk2WdoDrB4-Q8-gg' ) contact = await client . get_entity ( '+34xxxxxxxxx' ) friend = await client . get_entity ( friend_id ) # Getting entities through their ID (User, Chat or Channel) entity = await client . get_entity ( some_id ) # You can be more explicit about the type for said ID by wrapping # it inside a Peer instance. This is recommended but not necessary. from telethon.tl.types import PeerUser , PeerChat , PeerChannel my_user = await client . get_entity ( PeerUser ( some_id )) my_chat = await client . get_entity ( PeerChat ( some_id )) my_channel = await client . get_entity ( PeerChannel ( some_id )) Note You don't need to get the entity before using it! Just let the library do its job. Use a phone from your contacts, username, ID or input entity (preferred but not necessary), whatever you already have. All methods in the :ref: telethon-client call .get_input_entity() <telethon.client.users.UserMethods.get_input_entity> prior to sending the request to save you from the hassle of doing so manually. That way, convenience calls such as client.send_message('username', 'hi!') <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.send_message> become possible. Every entity the library encounters (in any response to any call) will by default be cached in the .session file (an SQLite database), to avoid performing unnecessary API calls. If the entity cannot be found, additonal calls like :tl: ResolveUsernameRequest or :tl: GetContactsRequest may be made to obtain the required information. Entities vs. Input Entities \u00b6 Note This section is informative, but worth reading. The library will transparently handle all of these details for you. On top of the normal types, the API also make use of what they call their Input* versions of objects. The input version of an entity (e.g. :tl: InputPeerUser , :tl: InputChat , etc.) only contains the minimum information that's required from Telegram to be able to identify who you're referring to: a :tl: Peer 's ID and hash . They are named like this because they are input parameters in the requests. Entities' ID are the same for all user and bot accounts, however, the access hash is different for each account , so trying to reuse the access hash from one account in another will not work. Sometimes, Telegram only needs to indicate the type of the entity along with their ID. For this purpose, :tl: Peer versions of the entities also exist, which just have the ID. You cannot get the hash out of them since you should not be needing it. The library probably has cached it before. Peers are enough to identify an entity, but they are not enough to make a request with them. You need to know their hash before you can \"use them\", and to know the hash you need to \"encounter\" them, let it be in your dialogs, participants, message forwards, etc. Note You can use peers with the library. Behind the scenes, they are replaced with the input variant. Peers \"aren't enough\" on their own but the library will do some more work to use the right type. As we just mentioned, API calls don't need to know the whole information about the entities, only their ID and hash. For this reason, another method, client.get_input_entity() <telethon.client.users.UserMethods.get_input_entity> is available. This will always use the cache while possible, making zero API calls most of the time. When a request is made, if you provided the full entity, e.g. an :tl: User , the library will convert it to the required :tl: InputPeer automatically for you. You should always favour client.get_input_entity() <telethon.client.users.UserMethods.get_input_entity> over client.get_entity() <telethon.client.users.UserMethods.get_entity> for this reason! Calling the latter will always make an API call to get the most recent information about said entity, but invoking requests don't need this information, just the :tl: InputPeer . Only use client.get_entity() <telethon.client.users.UserMethods.get_entity> if you need to get actual information, like the username, name, title, etc. of the entity. To further simplify the workflow, since the version 0.16.2 of the library, the raw requests you make to the API are also able to call client.get_input_entity() <telethon.client.users.UserMethods.get_input_entity> wherever needed, so you can even do things like: await client ( SendMessageRequest ( 'username' , 'hello' )) The library will call the .resolve() method of the request, which will resolve 'username' with the appropriated :tl: InputPeer . Don't worry if you don't get this yet, but remember some of the details here are important. Full Entities \u00b6 In addition to :tl: PeerUser , :tl: InputPeerUser , :tl: User (and its variants for chats and channels), there is also the concept of :tl: UserFull . This full variant has additional information such as whether the user is blocked, its notification settings, the bio or about of the user, etc. There is also :tl: messages.ChatFull which is the equivalent of full entities for chats and channels, with also the about section of the channel. Note that the users field only contains bots for the channel (so that clients can suggest commands to use). You can get both of these by invoking :tl: GetFullUser , :tl: GetFullChat and :tl: GetFullChannel respectively. Accessing Entities \u00b6 Although it's explicitly noted in the documentation that messages subclass ChatGetter <telethon.tl.custom.chatgetter.ChatGetter> and SenderGetter <telethon.tl.custom.sendergetter.SenderGetter> , some people still don't get inheritance. When the documentation says \"Bases: telethon.tl.custom.chatgetter.ChatGetter \" it means that the class you're looking at, also can act as the class it bases. In this case, ChatGetter <telethon.tl.custom.chatgetter.ChatGetter> knows how to get the chat where a thing belongs to. So, a Message <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message> is a ChatGetter <telethon.tl.custom.chatgetter.ChatGetter> . That means you can do this: message . is_private message . chat_id await message . get_chat () # ...etc SenderGetter <telethon.tl.custom.sendergetter.SenderGetter> is similar: message . user_id await message . get_input_user () message . user # ...etc Quite a few things implement them, so it makes sense to reuse the code. For example, all events (except raw updates) implement ChatGetter <telethon.tl.custom.chatgetter.ChatGetter> since all events occur in some chat. Summary \u00b6 TL;DR; If you're here because of \"Could not find the input entity for\" , you must ask yourself \"how did I find this entity through official applications\"? Now do the same with the library. Use what applies: # (These examples assume you are inside an \"async def\") async with client : # Does it have an username? Use it! entity = await client . get_entity ( username ) # Do you have a conversation open with them? Get dialogs. await client . get_dialogs () # Are they participant of some group? Get them. await client . get_participants ( 'TelethonChat' ) # Is the entity the original sender of a forwarded message? Get it. await client . get_messages ( 'TelethonChat' , 100 ) # NOW you can use the ID, anywhere! await client . send_message ( 123456 , 'Hi!' ) entity = await client . get_entity ( 123456 ) print ( entity ) Once the library has \"seen\" the entity, you can use their integer ID. You can't use entities from IDs the library hasn't seen. You must make the library see them at least once and disconnect properly. You know where the entities are and you must tell the library. It won't guess for you.","title":"Entities"},{"location":"concepts/entities/#entities","text":"The library widely uses the concept of \"entities\".

In this case, ChatGetter <telethon.tl.custom.chatgetter.ChatGetter> knows how to get the chat where a thing belongs to. So, a Message <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message> is a ChatGetter <telethon.tl.custom.chatgetter.ChatGetter> .

What are Sessions? \u00b6 The first parameter you pass to the constructor of the :ref: TelegramClient <telethon-client> is the session , and defaults to be the session name (or full path). That is, if you create a TelegramClient('anon') instance and connect, an anon.session file will be created in the working directory. Note that if you pass a string it will be a file in the current working directory, although you can also pass absolute paths. The session file contains enough information for you to login without re-sending the code, so if you have to enter the code more than once, maybe you're changing the working directory, renaming or removing the file, or using random names. These database files using sqlite3 contain the required information to talk to the Telegram servers, such as to which IP the client should connect, port, authorization key so that messages can be encrypted, and so on. These files will by default also save all the input entities that you've seen, so that you can get information about a user or channel by just their ID. Telegram will not send their access_hash required to retrieve more information about them, if it thinks you have already seem them. For this reason, the library needs to store this information offline. The library will by default too save all the entities (chats and channels with their name and username, and users with the phone too) in the session file, so that you can quickly access them by username or phone number. If you're not going to work with updates, or don't need to cache the access_hash associated with the entities' ID, you can disable this by setting client.session.save_entities = False . Different Session Storage \u00b6 If you don't want to use the default SQLite session storage, you can also use one of the other implementations or implement your own storage. While it's often not the case, it's possible that SQLite is slow enough to be noticeable, in which case you can also use a different storage. Note that this is rare and most people won't have this issue, but it's worth a mention. To use a custom session storage, simply pass the custom session instance to :ref: TelegramClient <telethon-client> instead of the session name. Telethon contains three implementations of the abstract Session class: MemorySession <memory.MemorySession> : stores session data within memory. SQLiteSession <sqlite.SQLiteSession> : stores sessions within on-disk SQLite databases. Default. StringSession <string.StringSession> : stores session data within memory, but can be saved as a string. You can import these from telethon.sessions . For example, using the StringSession <string.StringSession> is done as follows: from telethon.sync import TelegramClient from telethon.sessions import StringSession with TelegramClient ( StringSession ( string ), api_id , api_hash ) as client : ... # use the client # Save the string session as a string; you should decide how # you want to save this information (over a socket, remote # database, print it and then paste the string in the code, # etc.); the advantage is that you don't need to save it # on the current disk as a separate file, and can be reused # anywhere else once you log in. string = client . session . save () # Note that it's also possible to save any other session type # as a string by using ``StringSession.save(session_instance)``: client = TelegramClient ( 'sqlite-session' , api_id , api_hash ) string = StringSession . save ( client . session ) There are other community-maintained implementations available: SQLAlchemy : stores all sessions in a single database via SQLAlchemy. Redis : stores all sessions in a single Redis data store. MongoDB : stores the current session in a MongoDB database. Creating your Own Storage \u00b6 The easiest way to create your own storage implementation is to use MemorySession <memory.MemorySession> as the base and check out how SQLiteSession <sqlite.SQLiteSession> or one of the community-maintained implementations work. You can find the relevant Python files under the sessions/ directory in the Telethon's repository. After you have made your own implementation, you can add it to the community-maintained session implementation list above with a pull request. String Sessions \u00b6 StringSession <string.StringSession> are a convenient way to embed your login credentials directly into your code for extremely easy portability, since all they take is a string to be able to login without asking for your phone and code (or faster start if you're using a bot token). The easiest way to generate a string session is as follows: from telethon.sync import TelegramClient from telethon.sessions import StringSession with TelegramClient ( StringSession (), api_id , api_hash ) as client : print ( client . session . save ()) Think of this as a way to export your authorization key (what's needed to login into your account). This will print a string in the standard output (likely your terminal). Warning Keep this string safe! Anyone with this string can use it to login into your account and do anything they want to to do. This is similar to leaking your *.session files online, but it is easier to leak a string than it is to leak a file. Once you have the string (which is a bit long), load it into your script somehow.

However events are different to other methods in the client, like client.get_messages <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.get_messages> . Events may not send information about the sender or chat, which means it can be None , but all the methods defined in the client always have this information so it doesn't need to be re-fetched. For this reason, you have get_ methods, which will make a network call if necessary. In short, you should do this: @client . on ( events . NewMessage ) async def handler ( event ): # event.input_chat may be None, use event.get_input_chat() chat = await event . get_input_chat () sender = await event . get_sender () buttons = await event . get_buttons () async def main (): async for message in client . iter_messages ( 'me' , 10 ): # Methods from the client always have these properties ready chat = message . input_chat sender = message . sender buttons = message . buttons Notice, properties ( message.sender <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.sender> ) don't need an await , but methods ( message.get_sender <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.get_sender> ) do need an await , and you should use methods in events for these properties that may need network. Events Without the client \u00b6 The code of your application starts getting big, so you decide to separate the handlers into different files. But how can you access the client from these files? You don't need to! Just events.register <telethon.events.register> them: # handlers/welcome.py from telethon import events @events . register ( events . NewMessage ( '(?i)hello' )) async def handler ( event ): client = event . client await event . respond ( 'Hey!' ) await client . send_message ( 'me' , 'I said hello to someone' ) Registering events is a way of saying \"this method is an event handler\". You can use telethon.events.is_handler to check if any method is a handler. You can think of them as a different approach to Flask's blueprints. It's important to note that this does not add the handler to any client! You never specified the client on which the handler should be used. You only declared that it is a handler, and its type. To actually use the handler, you need to client.add_event_handler <telethon.client.updates.UpdateMethods.add_event_handler> to the client (or clients) where they should be added to: # main.py from telethon import TelegramClient import handlers.welcome with TelegramClient ( ... ) as client : client . add_event_handler ( handlers . welcome . handler ) client . run_until_disconnected () This also means that you can register an event handler once and then add it to many clients without re-declaring the event. Events Without Decorators \u00b6 If for any reason you don't want to use telethon.events.register , you can explicitly pass the event handler to use to the mentioned client.add_event_handler <telethon.client.updates.UpdateMethods.add_event_handler> : from telethon import TelegramClient , events async def handler ( event ): ... with TelegramClient ( ... ) as client : client . add_event_handler ( handler , events . NewMessage ) client . run_until_disconnected () Similarly, you also have client.remove_event_handler <telethon.client.updates.UpdateMethods.remove_event_handler> and client.list_event_handlers <telethon.client.updates.UpdateMethods.list_event_handlers> . The event argument is optional in all three methods and defaults to events.Raw <telethon.events.raw.Raw> for adding, and None when removing (so all callbacks would be removed). Note The event type is ignored in client.add_event_handler <telethon.client.updates.UpdateMethods.add_event_handler> if you have used telethon.events.register on the callback before, since that's the point of using such method at all. Stopping Propagation of Updates \u00b6 There might be cases when an event handler is supposed to be used solitary and it makes no sense to process any other handlers in the chain. For this case, it is possible to raise a telethon.events.StopPropagation exception which will cause the propagation of the update through your handlers to stop: from telethon.events import StopPropagation @client . on ( events . NewMessage ) async def _ ( event ): # ... some conditions await event . delete () # Other handlers won't have an event to work with raise StopPropagation @client . on ( events . NewMessage ) async def _ ( event ): # Will never be reached, because it is the second handler # in the chain. pass Remember to check :ref: telethon-events if you're looking for the methods reference. Understanding asyncio \u00b6 With asyncio , the library has several tasks running in the background. One task is used for sending requests, another task is used to receive them, and a third one is used to handle updates. To handle updates, you must keep your script running. You can do this in several ways. For instance, if you are not running asyncio 's event loop, you should use client.run_until_disconnected <telethon.client.updates.UpdateMethods.run_until_disconnected> : import asyncio from telethon import TelegramClient client = TelegramClient ( ... ) ... client . run_until_disconnected () Behind the scenes, this method is await 'ing on the client.disconnected <telethon.client.telegrambaseclient.TelegramBaseClient.disconnected> property, so the code above and the following are equivalent: import asyncio from telethon import TelegramClient client = TelegramClient ( ... ) async def main (): await client . disconnected loop = asyncio . get_event_loop () loop . run_until_complete ( main ()) You could also run client.disconnected <telethon.client.telegrambaseclient.TelegramBaseClient.disconnected> until it completed. But if you don't want to await , then you should know what you want to be doing instead! What matters is that you shouldn't let your script die. If you don't care about updates, you don't need any of this. Notice that unlike client.disconnected <telethon.client.telegrambaseclient.TelegramBaseClient.disconnected> , client.run_until_disconnected <telethon.client.updates.UpdateMethods.run_until_disconnected> will handle KeyboardInterrupt with you. This method is special and can also be ran while the loop is running, so you can do this: async def main (): await client . run_until_disconnected () loop . run_until_complete ( main ()) Sequential Updates \u00b6 If you need to process updates sequentially (i.e. not in parallel), you should set sequential_updates=True when creating the client: with TelegramClient ( ... , sequential_updates = True ) as client : ...","title":"Updates in Dept"},{"location":"concepts/updates/#updates-in-dept","text":"","title":"Updates in Dept"},{"location":"concepts/updates/#properties-vs-methods","text":"The event shown above acts just like a custom.Message <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message> , which means you can access all the properties it has, like .sender .

Events may not send information about the sender or chat, which means it can be None , but all the methods defined in the client always have this information so it doesn't need to be re-fetched. For this reason, you have get_ methods, which will make a network call if necessary. In short, you should do this: @client . on ( events . NewMessage ) async def handler ( event ): # event.input_chat may be None, use event.get_input_chat() chat = await event . get_input_chat () sender = await event . get_sender () buttons = await event . get_buttons () async def main (): async for message in client . iter_messages ( 'me' , 10 ): # Methods from the client always have these properties ready chat = message . input_chat sender = message . sender buttons = message . buttons Notice, properties ( message.sender <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.sender> ) don't need an await , but methods ( message.get_sender <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.get_sender> ) do need an await , and you should use methods in events for these properties that may need network.","title":"Properties vs. Methods"},{"location":"concepts/updates/#events-without-the-client","text":"The code of your application starts getting big, so you decide to separate the handlers into different files.

Brief Introduction to Pytest \u00b6 Pytest is a tool for discovering and running python tests, as well as allowing modular reuse of test setup code using fixtures. Most Pytest tests will look something like this:: from module import my_thing , my_other_thing def test_my_thing ( fixture ): assert my_thing ( fixture ) == 42 @pytest . mark . asyncio async def test_my_thing ( event_loop ): assert await my_other_thing ( loop = event_loop ) == 42 Note here: The test imports one specific function. The role of unit tests is to test that the implementation of some unit, like a function or class, works. It's role is not so much to test that components interact well with each other. I/O, such as connecting to remote servers, should be avoided. This helps with quickly identifying the source of an error, finding silent breakage, and makes it easier to cover all possible code paths. System or integration tests can also be useful, but are currently out of scope of Telethon's automated testing. A function test_my_thing is declared. Pytest searches for files starting with test_ , classes starting with Test and executes any functions or methods starting with test_ it finds. The function is declared with a parameter fixture . Fixtures are used to request things required to run the test, such as temporary directories, free TCP ports, Connections, etc. Fixtures are declared by simply adding the fixture name as parameter. A full list of available fixtures can be found with the pytest --fixtures command. The test uses a simple assert to test some condition is valid. Pytest uses some magic to ensure that the errors from this are readable and easy to debug. The pytest.mark.asyncio fixture is provided by pytest-asyncio . It starts a loop and executes a test function as coroutine. This should be used for testing asyncio code. It also declares the event_loop fixture, which will request an asyncio event loop. Brief Introduction to Tox \u00b6 Tox is a tool for automated setup of virtual environments for testing. While the tests can be run directly by just running pytest , this only tests one specific python version in your existing environment, which will not catch e.g. undeclared dependencies, or version incompatabilities. Tox environments are declared in the tox.ini file. The default environments, declared at the top, can be simply run with tox . The option tox -e py36,flake can be used to request specific environments to be run. Brief Introduction to Pytest-cov \u00b6 Coverage is a useful metric for testing. It measures the lines of code and branches that are exercised by the tests. The higher the coverage, the more likely it is that any coding errors will be caught by the tests. A brief coverage report can be generated with the --cov option to tox , which will be passed on to pytest . Additionally, the very useful HTML report can be generated with --cov --cov-report=html , which contains a browsable copy of the source code, annotated with coverage information for each line.","title":"Tests"},{"location":"developing/testing/#tests","text":"Telethon uses Pytest for testing, Tox for environment setup, and pytest-asyncio and pytest-cov for asyncio and coverage integration.

Minor quality of life improvements (v1.14) \u00b6 Published at 2020/05/26 Scheme layer used: 113 Some nice things that were missing, along with the usual bug-fixes. Additions \u00b6 New Message.dice <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.dice> property. The func= parameter of events can now be an async function. Bug fixes \u00b6 Fixed client.action() <telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.action> having an alias wrong. Fixed incorrect formatting of some errors. Probably more reliable detection of pin events in small groups. Fixed send methods on client.conversation() <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.conversation> were not honoring cancellation. Flood waits of zero seconds are handled better. Getting the pinned message in a chat was failing. Fixed the return value when forwarding messages if some were missing and also the return value of albums. Enhancements \u00b6 .tgs files are now recognised as animated stickers. The service message produced by Message.pin() <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.pin> is now returned. Sending a file with client.send_file() <telethon.client.uploads.UploadMethods.send_file> now works fine when you pass an existing dice media (e.g. sending a message copy). client.edit_permissions() <telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.edit_permissions> now has the embed_links parameter which was missing. Bug Fixes (v1.13) \u00b6 Published at 2020/04/25 Scheme layer used: 112 Bug fixes and layer bump. Bug fixes \u00b6 Passing None as the entity to client.delete_messages() <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.delete_messages> would fail. When downloading a thumbnail, the name inferred was wrong. Bug Fixes (v1.12) \u00b6 Published at 2020/04/20 Scheme layer used: 111 Once again nothing major, but a few bug fixes and primarily the new layer deserves a new minor release. Bug fixes \u00b6 These were already included in the v1.11.3 patch: libssl check was failing on macOS. Getting input users would sometimes fail on events.ChatAction <telethon.events.chataction.ChatAction> . These bug fixes are available in this release and beyond: Avoid another occurrence of MemoryError . Sending large files in albums would fail because it tried to cache them. The thumb was being ignored when sending files from :tl: InputFile . Fixed editing inline messages from callback queries in some cases. Proxy connection is now blocking which should help avoid some errors. Bug Fixes (v1.11) \u00b6 Published at 2020/02/20 Scheme layer used: 110 It has been a while since the last release, and a few bug fixes have been made since then. This release includes them and updates the scheme layer. Note that most of the bug-fixes are available in the v1.10.10 patch. Bug fixes \u00b6 Fix MemoryError when casting certain media. Fix client.get_entity() <telethon.client.users.UserMethods.get_entity> on small group chats. client.delete_dialog() <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.delete_dialog> now handles deactivated chats more gracefully. Sending a message with file= would ignore some of the parameters. Errors are now un-pickle-able once again. Fixed some issues regarding markdown and HTML (un)parsing. The following are also present in v1.10.10 : Fixed some issues with events.Album <telethon.events.album.Album> . Fixed some issues with client.kick_participant() <telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.kick_participant> and client.edit_admin() <telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.edit_admin> . Fixed sending albums and more within client.conversation() <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.conversation> . Fixed some import issues. And a lot more minor stuff. Enhancements \u00b6 Videos can now be included when sending albums. Getting updates after reconnect should be more reliable. Updated documentation and added more examples. More security checks during the generation of the authorization key. The following are also present in v1.10.10 : URLs like t.me/@username are now valid. Auto-sleep now works for slow-mode too. Improved some error messages. Some internal improvements and updating. client.pin_message() <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.pin_message> now also works with message objects. Asynchronous file descriptors are now allowed during download and upload. Scheduled Messages (v1.10) \u00b6 Published at 2019/09/08 Scheme layer used: 105 You can now schedule messages to be sent (or edited, or forwarded\u2026) at a later time, which can also work as reminders for yourself when used in your own chat! from datetime import timedelta # Remind yourself to walk the dog in 10 minutes (after you play with Telethon's update) await client . send_message ( 'me' , 'Walk the dog' , schedule = timedelta ( minutes = 10 )) # Remind your friend tomorrow to update Telethon await client . send_message ( friend , 'Update Telethon!' , schedule = timedelta ( days = 1 )) Additions \u00b6 New Button.auth <telethon.tl.custom.button.Button.auth> friendly button you can use to ask users to login to your bot. Telethon's repository now contains *.nix expressions that you can use. New client.kick_participant() <telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.kick_participant> method to truly kick (not ban) participants. New schedule parameter in client.send_message() <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.send_message> , client.edit_message() <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.edit_message> , client.forward_messages() <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.forward_messages> and client.send_file() <telethon.client.uploads.UploadMethods.send_file> . Bug fixes \u00b6 Fix calling flush on file objects which lack this attribute. Fix CallbackQuery <telethon.events.callbackquery.CallbackQuery> pattern. Fix client.action() <telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.action> not returning itself when used in a context manager (so the as would be None ). Fix sending :tl: InputKeyboardButtonUrlAuth as inline buttons. Fix client.edit_permissions() <telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.edit_permissions> defaults. Fix Forward <telethon.tl.custom.forward.Forward> had its client as None . Fix (de)serialization of negative timestamps (caused by the information in some sites with instant view, where the date could be very old). Fix HTML un-parsing. Fix to/from_id in private messages when using multiple clients. Stop disconnecting from None (incorrect logging). Fix double-read on double-connect. Fix client.get_messages() <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.get_messages> when being passed more than 100 IDs. Fix Message.document <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.document> for documents coming from web-pages. Enhancements \u00b6 Some documentation improvements, including the TL reference. Documentation now avoids telethon.sync , which should hopefully be less confusing. Better error messages for flood wait. You can now client.get_drafts() <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.get_drafts> for a single entity (which means you can now get a single draft from a single chat). New-style file IDs now work with Telethon. The progress_callback for client.upload_file() <telethon.client.uploads.UploadMethods.upload_file> can now be an async def . Animated Stickers (v1.9) \u00b6 Published at 2019/07/06 +------------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 103 | +------------------------+ With the layer 103, Telethon is now able to send and receive animated stickers! These use the 'application/x-tgsticker' mime-type and for now, you can access its raw data, which is a gzipped JSON. Additions * New `events.Album <telethon.events.album.Album>` to easily receive entire albums! * New `client.edit_admin() <telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.edit_admin>` and `client.edit_permissions() <telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.edit_permissions>` methods to more easily manage your groups. * New ``pattern=`` in `CallbackQuery <telethon.events.callbackquery.CallbackQuery>`. * New `conversation.cancel_all() <telethon.tl.custom.conversation.Conversation.cancel>` method, to cancel all currently-active conversations in a particular chat. * New `telethon.utils.encode_waveform` and `telethon.utils.decode_waveform` methods as implemented by Telegram Desktop, which lets you customize how voice notes will render. * New ``ignore_pinned`` parameter in `client.iter_dialogs() <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.iter_dialogs>`. * New `Message.mark_read() <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.mark_read>` method. * You can now use strike-through in markdown with ``~~text~~``, and the corresponding HTML tags for strike-through, quotes and underlined text. * You can now nest entities, as in ``**__text__**``. Bug fixes Fixed downloading contacts. Fixed client.iter_dialogs() <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.iter_dialogs> missing some under certain circumstances. Fixed incredibly slow imports under some systems due to expensive path resolution when searching for libssl . Fixed captions when sending albums. Fixed invalid states in Conversation <telethon.tl.custom.conversation.Conversation> . Fixes to some methods in utils regarding extensions. Fixed memory cycle in Forward <telethon.tl.custom.forward.Forward> which let you do things like the following: .. code-block:: python original_fwd = message.forward.original_fwd.original_fwd.original_fwd.original_fwd.original_fwd.original_fwd Hopefully you didn't rely on that in your code. * Fixed File.ext <telethon.tl.custom.file.File.ext> not working on unknown mime-types, despite the file name having the extension. * Fixed ids=..., reverse=True in client.iter_messages() <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.iter_messages> . * Fixed Draft <telethon.tl.custom.draft.Draft> not being aware of the entity. * Added missing re-exports in telethon.sync . Enhancements * Improved `conversation.cancel() <telethon.tl.custom.conversation.Conversation.cancel>` behaviour. Now you can use it from anywhere. * The ``progress_callback`` in `client.download_media() <telethon.client.downloads.DownloadMethods.download_media>` now lets you use ``async def``. * Improved documentation and the online method reference at https://tl.telethon.dev. Documentation Overhaul (v1.8) ============================= *Published at 2019/05/30* +------------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 100 | +------------------------+ The documentation has been completely reworked from the ground up, with awesome new quick references such as :ref:`client-ref` to help you quickly find what you need! Raw methods also warn you when a friendly variant is available, so that you don't accidentally make your life harder than it has to be. In addition, all methods in the client now are fully annotated with type hints! More work needs to be done, but this should already help a lot when using Telethon from any IDEs. You may have noticed that the patch versions between ``v1.7.2`` to ``v1.7.7`` have not been documented. This is because patch versions should only contain bug fixes, no new features or breaking changes. This hasn't been the case in the past, but from now on, the library will try to adhere more strictly to the `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org>`_ principles. If you ever want to look at those bug fixes, please use the appropriated ``git`` command, such as ``git shortlog v1.7.1...v1.7.4``, but in general, they probably just fixed your issue. With that out of the way, let's look at the full change set: Breaking Changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ * The layer changed, so take note if you use the raw API, as it's usual. * The way photos are downloaded changed during the layer update of the previous version, and fixing that bug as a breaking change in itself. `client.download_media() <telethon.client.downloads.DownloadMethods.download_media>` now offers a different way to deal with thumbnails. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ * New `Message.file <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.file>` property! Now you can trivially access `message.file.id <telethon.tl.custom.file.File.id>` to get the file ID of some media, or even ``print(message.file.name)``. * Archiving dialogs with `Dialog.archive() <telethon.tl.custom.dialog.Dialog.archive>` or `client.edit_folder() <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.edit_folder>` is now possible. * New cleaned-up method to stream downloads with `client.iter_download() <telethon.client.downloads.DownloadMethods.iter_download>`, which offers a lot of flexibility, such as arbitrary offsets for efficient seeking. * `Dialog.delete() <telethon.tl.custom.dialog.Dialog.delete>` has existed for a while, and now `client.delete_dialog() <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.delete_dialog>` exists too so you can easily leave chats or delete dialogs without fetching all dialogs. * Some people or chats have a lot of profile photos. You can now iterate over all of them with the new `client.iter_profile_photos() <telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.iter_profile_photos>` method. * You can now annoy everyone with the new `Message.pin(notify=True) <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.pin>`! The client has its own variant too, called `client.pin_message() <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.pin_message>`. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ * Correctly catch and raise all RPC errors. * Downloading stripped photos wouldn't work correctly. * Under some systems, ``libssl`` would fail to load earlier than expected, causing the library to fail when being imported. * `conv.get_response() <telethon.tl.custom.conversation.Conversation.get_response>` after ID 0 wasn't allowed when it should. * `InlineBuilder <telethon.tl.custom.inlinebuilder.InlineBuilder>` only worked with local files, but files from anywhere are supported. * Accessing the text property from a raw-API call to fetch :tl:`Message` would fail (any any other property that needed the client). * Database is now upgraded if the version was lower, not different. From now on, this should help with upgrades and downgrades slightly. * Fixed saving ``pts`` and session-related stuff. * Disconnection should not raise any errors. * Invite links of the form ``tg://join?invite=`` now work. * `client.iter_participants(search=...) <telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.iter_participants>` now works on private chats again. * Iterating over messages in reverse with a date as offset wouldn't work. * The conversation would behave weirdly when a timeout occurred. Enhancements telethon now re-export all the goodies that you commonly need when using the library, so e.g. from telethon import Button will now work. telethon.sync now re-exports everything from telethon , so that you can trivially import from just one place everything that you need. More attempts at reducing CPU usage after automatically fetching missing entities on events. This isn't a big deal, even if it sounds like one. Hexadecimal invite links are now supported. You didn't need them, but they will now work. Internal Changes * Deterministic code generation. This is good for ``diff``. * On Python 3.7 and above, we properly close the connection. * A lot of micro-optimization. * Fixes to bugs introduced while making this release. * Custom commands on ``setup.py`` are nicer to use. Fix-up for Photo Downloads (v1.7.1) =================================== *Published at 2019/04/24* Telegram changed the way thumbnails (which includes photos) are downloaded, so you can no longer use a :tl:`PhotoSize` alone to download a particular thumbnail size (this is a **breaking change**). Instead, you will have to specify the new ``thumb`` parameter in `client.download_media() <telethon.client.downloads.DownloadMethods.download_media>` to download a particular thumbnail size. This addition enables you to easily download thumbnails from documents, something you couldn't do easily before. Easier Events (v1.7) ==================== *Published at 2019/04/22* +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 98 | +-----------------------+ If you have been using Telethon for a while, you probably know how annoying the \"Could not find the input entity for\u2026\" error can be. In this new version, the library will try harder to find the input entity for you! That is, instead of doing: .. code-block:: python @client.on(events.NewMessage) async def handler(event): await client.download_profile_photo(await event.get_input_sender()) # ...... needs await, it's a method ^^^^^ ^^ You can now do: .. code-block:: python @client.on(events.NewMessage) async def handler(event): await client.download_profile_photo(event.input_sender) # ...... no await, it's a property! ^ # It's also 12 characters shorter :) And even the following will hopefully work: .. code-block:: python @client.on(events.NewMessage) async def handler(event): await client.download_profile_photo(event.sender_id) A lot of people use IDs thinking this is the right way of doing it. Ideally, you would always use ``input_*``, not ``sender`` or ``sender_id`` (and the same applies to chats). But, with this change, IDs will work just the same as ``input_*`` inside events. **This feature still needs some more testing**, so please do open an issue if you find strange behaviour. Breaking Changes The layer changed, and a lot of things did too. If you are using raw API, you should be careful with this. In addition, some attributes weren't of type datetime when they should be, which has been fixed. Due to the layer change, you can no longer download photos with just their :tl: PhotoSize . Version 1.7.1 introduces a new way to download thumbnails to work around this issue. client.disconnect() <telethon.client.telegrambaseclient.TelegramBaseClient.disconnect> is now asynchronous again. This means you need to await it. You don't need to worry about this if you were using with client or client.run_until_disconnected <telethon.client.updates.UpdateMethods.run_until_disconnected> . This should prevent the \"pending task was destroyed\" errors. Additions * New in-memory cache for input entities. This should mean a lot less of disk look-ups. * New `client.action <telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.action>` method to easily indicate that you are doing some chat action: .. code-block:: python async with client.action(chat, 'typing'): await asyncio.sleep(2) # type for 2 seconds await client.send_message(chat, 'Hello world! I type slow ^^') You can also easily use this for sending files, playing games, etc. New bugs ~~~~~~~~ * Downloading photos is broken. This is fixed in v1.7.1. Bug fixes Fix sending photos from streams/bytes. Fix unhandled error when sending requests that were too big. Fix edits that arrive too early on conversations. Fix client.edit_message() <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.edit_message> when trying to edit a file. Fix method calls on the objects returned by client.iter_dialogs() <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.iter_dialogs> . Attempt at fixing client.iter_dialogs() <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.iter_dialogs> missing many dialogs. offset_date in client.iter_messages() <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.iter_messages> was being ignored in some cases. This has been worked around. Fix callback_query.edit() <telethon.events.callbackquery.CallbackQuery.Event.edit> . Fix CallbackQuery(func=...) <telethon.events.callbackquery.CallbackQuery> was being ignored. Fix UserUpdate <telethon.events.userupdate.UserUpdate> not working for \"typing\" (and uploading file, etc.) status. Fix library was not expecting IOError from PySocks. Fix library was raising a generic ConnectionError and not the one that actually occurred. Fix the blacklist_chats parameter in MessageRead <telethon.events.messageread.MessageRead> not working as intended. Fix client.download_media(contact) <telethon.client.downloads.DownloadMethods.download_media> . Fix mime type when sending mp3 files. Fix forcibly getting the sender or chat from events would not always return all their information. Fix sending albums with client.send_file() <telethon.client.uploads.UploadMethods.send_file> was not returning the sent messages. Fix forwarding albums with client.forward_messages() <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.forward_messages> . Some fixes regarding filtering updates from chats. Attempt at preventing duplicated updates. Prevent double auto-reconnect. Enhancements * Some improvements related to proxy connections. * Several updates and improvements to the documentation, such as optional dependencies now being properly listed. * You can now forward messages from different chats directly with `client.forward_messages <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.forward_messages>`. Tidying up Internals (v1.6) =========================== *Published at 2019/02/27* +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 95 | +-----------------------+ First things first, sorry for updating the layer in the previous patch version. That should only be done between major versions ideally, but due to how Telegram works, it's done between minor versions. However raw API has and will always be considered \"unsafe\", this meaning that you should always use the convenience client methods instead. These methods don't cover the full API yet, so pull requests are welcome. Breaking Changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ * The layer update, of course. This didn't really need a mention here. * You can no longer pass a ``batch_size`` when iterating over messages. No other method exposed this parameter, and it was only meant for testing purposes. Instead, it's now a private constant. * ``client.iter_*`` methods no longer have a ``_total`` parameter which was supposed to be private anyway. Instead, they return a new generator object which has a ``.total`` attribute: .. code-block:: python it = client.iter_messages(chat) for i, message in enumerate(it, start=1): percentage = i / it.total print('{:.2%} {}'.format(percentage, message.text)) Additions ~~~~~~~~~ * You can now pass ``phone`` and ``phone_code_hash`` in `client.sign_up <telethon.client.auth.AuthMethods.sign_up>`, although you probably don't need that. * Thanks to the overhaul of all ``client.iter_*`` methods, you can now do: .. code-block:: python for message in reversed(client.iter_messages('me')): print(message.text) Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ * Fix `telethon.utils.resolve_bot_file_id`, which wasn't working after the layer update (so you couldn't send some files by bot file IDs). * Fix sending albums as bot file IDs (due to image detection improvements). * Fix `takeout() <telethon.client.account.AccountMethods.takeout>` failing when they need to download media from other DCs. * Fix repeatedly calling `conversation.get_response() <telethon.tl.custom.conversation.Conversation.get_response>` when many messages arrived at once (i.e. when several of them were forwarded). * Fixed connecting with `ConnectionTcpObfuscated <telethon.network.connection.tcpobfuscated.ConnectionTcpObfuscated>`. * Fix `client.get_peer_id('me') <telethon.client.users.UserMethods.get_peer_id>`. * Fix warning of \"missing sqlite3\" when in reality it just had wrong tables. * Fix a strange error when using too many IDs in `client.delete_messages() <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.delete_messages>`. * Fix `client.send_file <telethon.client.uploads.UploadMethods.send_file>` with the result of `client.upload_file <telethon.client.uploads.UploadMethods.upload_file>`. * When answering inline results, their order was not being preserved. * Fix `events.ChatAction <telethon.events.chataction.ChatAction>` detecting user leaves as if they were kicked. Enhancements Cleared up some parts of the documentation. Improved some auto-casts to make life easier. Improved image detection. Now you can easily send bytes and streams of images as photos, unless you force document. Sending images as photos that are too large will now be resized before uploading, reducing the time it takes to upload them and also avoiding errors when the image was too large (as long as pillow is installed). The images will remain unchanged if you send it as a document. Treat errors.RpcMcgetFailError as a temporary server error to automatically retry shortly. This works around most issues. Internal changes * New common way to deal with retries (``retry_range``). * Cleaned up the takeout client. * Completely overhauled asynchronous generators. Layer Update (v1.5.5) ===================== *Published at 2019/01/14* +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 93 | +-----------------------+ There isn't an entry for v1.5.4 because it contained only one hot-fix regarding loggers. This update is slightly bigger so it deserves mention. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ * New ``supports_streaming`` parameter in `client.send_file <telethon.client.uploads.UploadMethods.send_file>`. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ * Dealing with mimetypes should cause less issues in systems like Windows. * Potentially fix alternative session storages that had issues with dates. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ * Saner timeout defaults for conversations. * ``Path``-like files are now supported for thumbnails. * Added new hot-keys to the online documentation at https://tl.telethon.dev/ such as ``/`` to search. Press ``?`` to view them all. Bug Fixes (v1.5.3) ================== *Published at 2019/01/14* Several bug fixes and some quality of life enhancements. Breaking Changes message.edit <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.edit> now respects the previous message buttons or link preview being hidden. If you want to toggle them you need to explicitly set them. This is generally the desired behaviour, but may cause some bots to have buttons when they shouldn't. Additions * You can now \"hide_via\" when clicking on results from `client.inline_query <telethon.client.bots.BotMethods.inline_query>` to @bing and @gif. * You can now further configure the logger Telethon uses to suit your needs. Bug fixes Fixes for ReadTheDocs to correctly build the documentation. Fix :tl: UserEmpty not being expected when getting the input variant. The message object returned when sending a message with buttons wouldn't always contain the :tl: ReplyMarkup . Setting email when configuring 2FA wasn't properly supported. utils.resolve_bot_file_id now works again for photos. Enhancements * Chat and channel participants can now be used as peers. * Reworked README and examples at https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/tree/master/telethon_examples Takeout Sessions (v1.5.2) ========================= *Published at 2019/01/05* You can now easily start takeout sessions (also known as data export sessions) through `client.takeout() <telethon.client.account.AccountMethods.takeout>`. Some of the requests will have lower flood limits when done through the takeout session. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ * The new `AdminLogEvent <telethon.tl.custom.adminlogevent.AdminLogEvent>` had a bug that made it unusable. * `client.iter_dialogs() <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.iter_dialogs>` will now locally check for the offset date, since Telegram ignores it. * Answering inline queries with media no works properly. You can now use the library to create inline bots and send stickers through them! object.to_json() (v1.5.1) ========================= *Published at 2019/01/03* The library already had a way to easily convert the objects the API returned into dictionaries through ``object.to_dict()``, but some of the fields are dates or `bytes` which JSON can't serialize directly. For convenience, a new ``object.to_json()`` has been added which will by default format both of those problematic types into something sensible. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ * New `client.iter_admin_log() <telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.iter_admin_log>` method. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ * `client.is_connected() <telethon.client.telegrambaseclient.TelegramBaseClient.is_connected>` would be wrong when the initial connection failed. * Fixed ``UnicodeDecodeError`` when accessing the text of messages with malformed offsets in their entities. * Fixed `client.get_input_entity() <telethon.client.users.UserMethods.get_input_entity>` for integer IDs that the client has not seen before. Enhancements You can now configure the reply markup when using Button <telethon.tl.custom.button.Button> as a bot. More properties for Message <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message> to make accessing media convenient. Downloading to file=bytes will now return a bytes object with the downloaded media. Polls with the Latest Layer (v1.5) \u00b6 Published at 2018/12/25 +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 91 | +-----------------------+ This version doesn't really bring many new features, but rather focuses on updating the code base to support the latest available Telegram layer, 91. This layer brings polls, and you can create and manage them through Telethon! Breaking Changes * The layer change from 82 to 91 changed a lot of things in the raw API, so be aware that if you rely on raw API calls, you may need to update your code, in particular **if you work with files**. They have a new ``file_reference`` parameter that you must provide. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ * New `client.is_bot() <telethon.client.users.UserMethods.is_bot>` method. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ * Markdown and HTML parsing now behave correctly with leading whitespace. * HTTP connection should now work correctly again. * Using ``caption=None`` would raise an error instead of setting no caption. * ``KeyError`` is now handled properly when forwarding messages. * `button.click() <telethon.tl.custom.messagebutton.MessageButton.click>` now works as expected for :tl:`KeyboardButtonGame`. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ * Some improvements to the search in the full API and generated examples. * Using entities with ``access_hash = 0`` will now work in more cases. Internal changes Some changes to the documentation and code generation. 2FA code was updated to work under the latest layer. Error Descriptions in CSV files (v1.4.3) \u00b6 Published at 2018/12/04 While this may seem like a minor thing, it's a big usability improvement. Anyone who wants to update the documentation for known errors, or whether some methods can be used as a bot, user or both, can now be easily edited. Everyone is encouraged to help document this better! Bug fixes * ``TimeoutError`` was not handled during automatic reconnects. * Getting messages by ID using :tl:`InputMessageReplyTo` could fail. * Fixed `message.get_reply_message <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.get_reply_message>` as a bot when a user replied to a different bot. * Accessing some document properties in a `Message <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message>` would fail. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ * Accessing `events.ChatAction <telethon.events.chataction.ChatAction>` properties such as input users may now work in more cases. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ * Error descriptions and information about methods is now loaded from a CSV file instead of being part of several messy JSON files. Bug Fixes (v1.4.2) ================== *Published at 2018/11/24* This version also includes the v1.4.1 hot-fix, which was a single quick fix and didn't really deserve an entry in the changelog. Bug fixes Authorization key wouldn't be saved correctly, requiring re-login. Conversations with custom events failed to be cancelled. Fixed telethon.sync when using other threads. Fix markdown/HTML parser from failing with leading/trailing whitespace. Fix accessing chat_action_event.input_user property. Potentially improved handling unexpected disconnections. Enhancements * Better default behaviour for `client.send_read_acknowledge <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.send_read_acknowledge>`. * Clarified some points in the documentation. * Clearer errors for ``utils.get_peer*``. Connection Overhaul (v1.4) ========================== *Published at 2018/11/03* Yet again, a lot of work has been put into reworking the low level connection classes. This means ``asyncio.open_connection`` is now used correctly and the errors it can produce are handled properly. The separation between packing, encrypting and network is now abstracted away properly, so reasoning about the code is easier, making it more maintainable. As a user, you shouldn't worry about this, other than being aware that quite a few changes were made in the insides of the library and you should report any issues that you encounter with this version if any. Breaking Changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ * The threaded version of the library will no longer be maintained, primarily because it never was properly maintained anyway. If you have old code, stick with old versions of the library, such as ``0.19.1.6``. * Timeouts no longer accept ``timedelta``. Simply use seconds. * The ``callback`` parameter from `telethon.tl.custom.button.Button.inline()` was removed, since it had always been a bad idea. Adding the callback there meant a lot of extra work for every message sent, and only registering it after the first message was sent! Instead, use `telethon.events.callbackquery.CallbackQuery`. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ * New `dialog.delete() <telethon.tl.custom.dialog.Dialog.delete>` method. * New `conversation.cancel() <telethon.tl.custom.conversation.Conversation.cancel>` method. * New ``retry_delay`` delay for the client to be used on auto-reconnection. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ * Fixed `Conversation.wait_event() <telethon.tl.custom.conversation.Conversation.wait_event>`. * Fixed replying with photos/documents on inline results. * `client.is_user_authorized() <telethon.client.users.UserMethods.is_user_authorized>` now works correctly after `client.log_out() <telethon.client.auth.AuthMethods.log_out>`. * `dialog.is_group <telethon.tl.custom.dialog.Dialog>` now works for :tl:`ChatForbidden`. * Not using ``async with`` when needed is now a proper error. * `events.CallbackQuery <telethon.events.callbackquery.CallbackQuery>` with string regex was not working properly. * `client.get_entity('me') <telethon.client.users.UserMethods.get_entity>` now works again. * Empty codes when signing in are no longer valid. * Fixed file cache for in-memory sessions. Enhancements Support next_offset in inline_query.answer() <telethon.events.inlinequery.InlineQuery.Event.answer> . Support <a href=\"tg://user?id=123\"> mentions in HTML parse mode. New auto-casts for :tl: InputDocument and :tl: InputChatPhoto . Conversations are now exclusive per-chat by default. The request that caused a RPC error is now shown in the error message. New full API examples in the generated documentation. Fixed some broken links in the documentation. client.disconnect() <telethon.client.telegrambaseclient.TelegramBaseClient.disconnect> is now synchronous, but you can still await it for consistency or compatibility. Event Templates (v1.3) \u00b6 Published at 2018/09/22 If you have worked with Flask templates, you will love this update, since it gives you the same features but even more conveniently: .. code-block:: python # handlers/welcome.py from telethon import events @events.register(events.NewMessage('(?i)hello')) async def handler(event): client = event.client await event.respond('Hi!') await client.send_message('me', 'Sent hello to someone') This will register <telethon.events.register> the handler callback to handle new message events. Note that you didn't add this to any client yet, and this is the key point: you don't need a client to define handlers! You can add it later: .. code-block:: python # main.py from telethon import TelegramClient import handlers.welcome with TelegramClient(...) as client: # This line adds the handler we defined before for new messages client.add_event_handler(handlers.welcome.handler) client.run_until_disconnected() This should help you to split your big code base into a more modular design. Breaking Changes * ``.sender`` is the ``.chat`` when the message is sent in a broadcast channel. This makes sense, because the sender of the message was the channel itself, but you now must take into consideration that it may be either a :tl:`User` or :tl:`Channel` instead of being `None`. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ * New ``MultiError`` class when invoking many requests at once through ``client([requests])``. * New custom ``func=`` on all events. These will receive the entire event, and a good usage example is ``func=lambda e: e.is_private``. * New ``.web_preview`` field on messages. The ``.photo`` and ``.document`` will also return the media in the web preview if any, for convenience. * Callback queries now have a ``.chat`` in most circumstances. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ * Running code with `python3 -O` would remove critical code from asserts. * Fix some rare ghost disconnections after reconnecting. * Fix strange behavior for `send_message(chat, Message, reply_to=foo) <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.send_message>`. * The ``loop=`` argument was being pretty much ignored. * Fix ``MemorySession`` file caching. * The logic for getting entities from their username is now correct. * Fixes for sending stickers from ``.webp`` files in Windows, again. * Fix disconnection without being logged in. * Retrieving media from messages would fail. * Getting some messages by ID on private chats. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ * `iter_participants <telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.iter_participants>` will now use its ``search=`` as a symbol set when ``aggressive=True``, so you can do ``client.get_participants(group, aggressive=True, search='\u0430\u0431\u0432\u0433\u0434\u0435\u0451\u0436\u0437\u0438\u0439\u043a\u043b\u043c\u043d\u043e\u043f\u0440\u0441\u0442')``. * The ``StringSession`` supports custom encoding. * Callbacks for `telethon.client.auth.AuthMethods.start` can be ``async``. Internal changes Cherry-picked a commit to use asyncio.open_connection in the lowest level of the library. Do open issues if this causes trouble, but it should otherwise improve performance and reliability. Building and resolving events overhaul. Conversations, String Sessions and More (v1.2) \u00b6 Published at 2018/08/14 This is a big release! Quite a few things have been added to the library, such as the new Conversation <telethon.tl.custom.conversation.Conversation> . This makes it trivial to get tokens from @BotFather <https://t.me/BotFather> _: .. code-block:: python from telethon.tl import types with client.conversation('BotFather') as conv: conv.send_message('/mybots') message = conv.get_response() message.click(0) message = conv.get_edit() message.click(0) message = conv.get_edit() for _, token in message.get_entities_text(types.MessageEntityCode): print(token) In addition to that, you can now easily load and export session files without creating any on-disk file thanks to the StringSession : .. code-block:: python from telethon.sessions import StringSession string = StringSession.save(client.session) Check out :ref: sessions for more details. For those who aren't able to install cryptg , the support for libssl has been added back. While interfacing libssl is not as fast, the speed when downloading and sending files should really be noticeably faster. While those are the biggest things, there are still more things to be excited about. Additions - The mentioned method to start a new `client.conversation <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.conversation>`. - Implemented global search through `client.iter_messages <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.iter_messages>` with `None` entity. - New `client.inline_query <telethon.client.bots.BotMethods.inline_query>` method to perform inline queries. - Bot-API-style ``file_id`` can now be used to send files and download media. You can also access `telethon.utils.resolve_bot_file_id` and `telethon.utils.pack_bot_file_id` to resolve and create these file IDs yourself. Note that each user has its own ID for each file so you can't use a bot's ``file_id`` with your user, except stickers. - New `telethon.utils.get_peer`, useful when you expect a :tl:`Peer`. Bug fixes UTC timezone for telethon.events.userupdate.UserUpdate . Bug with certain input parameters when iterating messages. RPC errors without parent requests caused a crash, and better logging. incoming = outgoing = True was not working properly. Getting a message's ID was not working. File attributes not being inferred for open() 'ed files. Use MemorySession if sqlite3 is not installed by default. Self-user would not be saved to the session file after signing in. client.catch_up() <telethon.client.updates.UpdateMethods.catch_up> seems to be functional again. Enhancements - Updated documentation. - Invite links will now use cache, so using them as entities is cheaper. - You can reuse message buttons to send new messages with those buttons. - ``.to_dict()`` will now work even on invalid ``TLObject``'s. Better Custom Message (v1.1.1) ============================== *Published at 2018/07/23* The `custom.Message <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message>` class has been rewritten in a cleaner way and overall feels less hacky in the library. This should perform better than the previous way in which it was patched. The release is primarily intended to test this big change, but also fixes **Python 3.5.2 compatibility** which was broken due to a trailing comma. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ - Using ``functools.partial`` on event handlers broke updates if they had uncaught exceptions. - A bug under some session files where the sender would export authorization for the same data center, which is unsupported. - Some logical bugs in the custom message class. Bot Friendly (v1.1) =================== *Published at 2018/07/21* Two new event handlers to ease creating normal bots with the library, namely `events.InlineQuery <telethon.events.inlinequery.InlineQuery>` and `events.CallbackQuery <telethon.events.callbackquery.CallbackQuery>` for handling ``@InlineBot queries`` or reacting to a button click. For this second option, there is an even better way: .. code-block:: python from telethon.tl.custom import Button async def callback(event): await event.edit('Thank you!') bot.send_message(chat, 'Hello!', buttons=Button.inline('Click me', callback)) You can directly pass the callback when creating the button. This is fine for small bots but it will add the callback every time you send a message, so you probably should do this instead once you are done testing: .. code-block:: python markup = bot.build_reply_markup(Button.inline('Click me', callback)) bot.send_message(chat, 'Hello!', buttons=markup) And yes, you can create more complex button layouts with lists: .. code-block:: python from telethon import events global phone = '' @bot.on(events.CallbackQuery) async def handler(event): global phone if event.data == b'<': phone = phone[:-1] else: phone += event.data.decode('utf-8') await event.answer('Phone is now {}'.format(phone)) markup = bot.build_reply_markup([ [Button.inline('1'), Button.inline('2'), Button.inline('3')], [Button.inline('4'), Button.inline('5'), Button.inline('6')], [Button.inline('7'), Button.inline('8'), Button.inline('9')], [Button.inline('+'), Button.inline('0'), Button.inline('<')], ]) bot.send_message(chat, 'Enter a phone', buttons=markup) (Yes, there are better ways to do this). Now for the rest of things: Additions ~~~~~~~~~ - New `custom.Button <telethon.tl.custom.button.Button>` class to help you create inline (or normal) reply keyboards. You must sign in as a bot to use the ``buttons=`` parameters. - New events usable if you sign in as a bot: `events.InlineQuery <telethon.events.inlinequery.InlineQuery>` and `events.CallbackQuery <telethon.events.callbackquery.CallbackQuery>`. - New ``silent`` parameter when sending messages, usable in broadcast channels. - Documentation now has an entire section dedicate to how to use the client's friendly methods at *(removed broken link)*. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ - Empty ``except`` are no longer used which means sending a keyboard interrupt should now work properly. - The ``pts`` of incoming updates could be `None`. - UTC timezone information is properly set for read ``datetime``. - Some infinite recursion bugs in the custom message class. - :tl:`Updates` was being dispatched to raw handlers when it shouldn't. - Using proxies and HTTPS connection mode may now work properly. - Less flood waits when downloading media from different data centers, and the library will now detect them even before sending requests. Enhancements Interactive sign in now supports signing in with a bot token. timedelta is now supported where a date is expected, which means you can e.g. ban someone for timedelta(minutes=5) . Events are only built once and reused many times, which should save quite a few CPU cycles if you have a lot of the same type. You can now click inline buttons directly if you know their data. Internal changes - When downloading media, the right sender is directly used without previously triggering migrate errors. - Code reusing for getting the chat and the sender, which easily enables this feature for new types. New HTTP(S) Connection Mode (v1.0.4) ==================================== *Published at 2018/07/09* This release implements the HTTP connection mode to the library, which means certain proxies that only allow HTTP connections should now work properly. You can use it doing the following, like any other mode: .. code-block:: python from telethon import TelegramClient, sync from telethon.network import ConnectionHttp client = TelegramClient(..., connection=ConnectionHttp) with client: client.send_message('me', 'Hi!') Additions ~~~~~~~~~ - ``add_mark=`` is now back on ``utils.get_input_peer`` and also on `client.get_input_entity() <telethon.client.users.UserMethods.get_input_entity>`. - New `client.get_peer_id <telethon.client.users.UserMethods.get_peer_id>` convenience for ``utils.get_peer_id(await client.get_input_entity(peer))``. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ - If several `TLMessage` in a `MessageContainer` exceeds 1MB, it will no longer be automatically turned into one. This basically means that e.g. uploading 10 file parts at once will work properly again. - Documentation fixes and some missing ``await``. - Revert named argument for `client.forward_messages <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.forward_messages>` Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ - New auto-casts to :tl:`InputNotifyPeer` and ``chat_id``. Internal changes Outgoing TLMessage are now pre-packed so if there's an error when serializing the raw requests, the library will no longer swallow it. This also means re-sending packets doesn't need to re-pack their bytes. Iterate Messages in Reverse (v1.0.3) \u00b6 Published at 2018/07/04 +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 82 | +-----------------------+ Mostly bug fixes, but now there is a new parameter on client.iter_messages <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.iter_messages> to support reversing the order in which messages are returned. Additions - The mentioned ``reverse`` parameter when iterating over messages. - A new ``sequential_updates`` parameter when creating the client for updates to be processed sequentially. This is useful when you need to make sure that all updates are processed in order, such as a script that only forwards incoming messages somewhere else. Bug fixes Count was always None for message.button_count <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.button_count> . Some fixes when disconnecting upon dropping the client. Support for Python 3.4 in the sync version, and fix media download. Some issues with events when accessing the input chat or their media. Hachoir wouldn't automatically close the file after reading its metadata. Signing in required a named code= parameter, but usage without a name was really widespread so it has been reverted. Bug Fixes (v1.0.2) \u00b6 Published at 2018/06/28 Updated some asserts and parallel downloads, as well as some fixes for sync. Bug Fixes (v1.0.1) \u00b6 Published at 2018/06/27 And as usual, every major release has a few bugs that make the library unusable! This quick update should fix those, namely: Bug fixes - `client.start() <telethon.client.auth.AuthMethods.start>` was completely broken due to a last-time change requiring named arguments everywhere. - Since the rewrite, if your system clock was wrong, the connection would get stuck in an infinite \"bad message\" loop of responses from Telegram. - Accessing the buttons of a custom message wouldn't work in channels, which lead to fix a completely different bug regarding starting bots. - Disconnecting could complain if the magic ``telethon.sync`` was imported. - Successful automatic reconnections now ask Telegram to send updates to us once again as soon as the library is ready to listen for them. Synchronous magic (v1.0) ======================== *Published at 2018/06/27* .. important:: If you come from Telethon pre-1.0 you **really** want to read :ref:`compatibility-and-convenience` to port your scripts to the new version. The library has been around for well over a year. A lot of improvements have been made, a lot of user complaints have been fixed, and a lot of user desires have been implemented. It's time to consider the public API as stable, and remove some of the old methods that were around until now for compatibility reasons. But there's one more surprise! There is a new magic ``telethon.sync`` module to let you use **all** the methods in the :ref:`TelegramClient <telethon-client>` (and the types returned from its functions) in a synchronous way, while using `asyncio` behind the scenes! This means you're now able to do both of the following: .. code-block:: python import asyncio async def main(): await client.send_message('me', 'Hello!') asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main()) # ...can be rewritten as: from telethon import sync client.send_message('me', 'Hello!') Both ways can coexist (you need to ``await`` if the loop is running). You can also use the magic ``sync`` module in your own classes, and call ``sync.syncify(cls)`` to convert all their ``async def`` into magic variants. Breaking Changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - ``message.get_fwd_sender`` is now in `message.forward <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.forward>`. - ``client.idle`` is now `client.run_until_disconnected() <telethon.client.updates.UpdateMethods.run_until_disconnected>` - ``client.add_update_handler`` is now `client.add_event_handler <telethon.client.updates.UpdateMethods.add_event_handler>` - ``client.remove_update_handler`` is now `client.remove_event_handler <telethon.client.updates.UpdateMethods.remove_event_handler>` - ``client.list_update_handlers`` is now `client.list_event_handlers <telethon.client.updates.UpdateMethods.list_event_handlers>` - ``client.get_message_history`` is now `client.get_messages <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.get_messages>` - ``client.send_voice_note`` is now `client.send_file <telethon.client.uploads.UploadMethods.send_file>` with ``is_voice=True``. - ``client.invoke()`` is now ``client(...)``. - ``report_errors`` has been removed since it's currently not used, and ``flood_sleep_threshold`` is now part of the client. - The ``update_workers`` and ``spawn_read_thread`` arguments are gone. Simply remove them from your code when you create the client. - Methods with a lot of arguments can no longer be used without specifying their argument. Instead you need to use named arguments. This improves readability and not needing to learn the order of the arguments, which can also change. Additions client.send_file <telethon.client.uploads.UploadMethods.send_file> now accepts external http:// and https:// URLs. You can use the :ref: TelegramClient <telethon-client> inside of with blocks, which will client.start() <telethon.client.auth.AuthMethods.start> and disconnect() <telethon.client.telegrambaseclient.TelegramBaseClient.disconnect> the client for you: .. code-block:: python from telethon import TelegramClient, sync with TelegramClient(name, api_id, api_hash) as client: client.send_message('me', 'Hello!') Convenience at its maximum! You can even chain the .start() <telethon.client.auth.AuthMethods.start> method since it returns the instance of the client: .. code-block:: python with TelegramClient(name, api_id, api_hash).start(bot_token=token) as bot: bot.send_message(chat, 'Hello!') Bug fixes - There were some ``@property async def`` left, and some ``await property``. - \"User joined\" event was being treated as \"User was invited\". - SQLite's cursor should not be closed properly after usage. - ``await`` the updates task upon disconnection. - Some bug in Python 3.5.2's `asyncio` causing 100% CPU load if you forgot to call `client.disconnect() <telethon.client.telegrambaseclient.TelegramBaseClient.disconnect>`. The method is called for you on object destruction, but you still should disconnect manually or use a ``with`` block. - Some fixes regarding disconnecting on client deletion and properly saving the authorization key. - Passing a class to `message.get_entities_text <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.get_entities_text>` now works properly. - Iterating messages from a specific user in private messages now works. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ - Both `client.start() <telethon.client.auth.AuthMethods.start>` and `client.run_until_disconnected() <telethon.client.updates.UpdateMethods.run_until_disconnected>` can be ran in both a synchronous way (without starting the loop manually) or from an ``async def`` where they need to have an ``await``. Core Rewrite in asyncio (v1.0-rc1) ================================== *Published at 2018/06/24* +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 81 | +-----------------------+ This version is a major overhaul of the library internals. The core has been rewritten, cleaned up and refactored to fix some oddities that have been growing inside the library. This means that the code is easier to understand and reason about, including the code flow such as conditions, exceptions, where to reconnect, how the library should behave, and separating different retry types such as disconnections or call fails, but it also means that **some things will necessarily break** in this version. All requests that touch the network are now methods and need to have their ``await`` (or be ran until their completion). Also, the library finally has the simple logo it deserved: a carefully hand-written ``.svg`` file representing a T following Python's colours. Breaking Changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - If you relied on internals like the ``MtProtoSender`` and the ``TelegramBareClient``, both are gone. They are now `MTProtoSender <telethon.network.mtprotosender.MTProtoSender>` and `TelegramBaseClient <telethon.client.telegrambaseclient.TelegramBaseClient>` and they behave differently. - Underscores have been renamed from filenames. This means ``telethon.errors.rpc_error_list`` won't work, but you should have been using `telethon.errors` all this time instead. - `client.connect <telethon.client.telegrambaseclient.TelegramBaseClient.connect>` no longer returns `True` on success. Instead, you should ``except`` the possible ``ConnectionError`` and act accordingly. This makes it easier to not ignore the error. - You can no longer set ``retries=n`` when calling a request manually. The limit works differently now, and it's done on a per-client basis. - Accessing `.sender <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.sender>`, `.chat <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.chat>` and similar may *not* work in events anymore, since previously they could access the network. The new rule is that properties are not allowed to make API calls. You should use `.get_sender() <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.get_sender>`, `.get_chat() <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.get_chat>` instead while using events. You can safely access properties if you get messages through `client.get_messages() <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.get_messages>` or other methods in the client. - The above point means ``reply_message`` is now `.get_reply_message() <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.get_reply_message>`, and ``fwd_from_entity`` is now `get_fwd_sender() <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.get_fwd_sender>`. Also ``forward`` was gone in the previous version, and you should be using ``fwd_from`` instead. Additions Telegram's Terms Of Service are now accepted when creating a new account. This can possibly help avoid bans. This has no effect for accounts that were created before. The method reference <https://tl.telethon.dev/> _ now shows which methods can be used if you sign in with a bot_token . There's a new client.disconnected <telethon.client.telegrambaseclient.TelegramBaseClient.disconnected> future which you can wait on. When a disconnection occurs, you will now, instead letting it happen in the background. More configurable retries parameters, such as auto-reconnection, retries when connecting, and retries when sending a request. You can filter events.NewMessage <telethon.events.newmessage.NewMessage> by sender ID, and also whether they are forwards or not. New ignore_migrated parameter for client.iter_dialogs <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.iter_dialogs> . Bug fixes - Several fixes to `telethon.events.newmessage.NewMessage`. - Removed named ``length`` argument in ``to_bytes`` for PyPy. - Raw events failed due to not having ``._set_client``. - `message.get_entities_text <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.get_entities_text>` properly supports filtering, even if there are no message entities. - `message.click <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.click>` works better. - The server started sending :tl:`DraftMessageEmpty` which the library didn't handle correctly when getting dialogs. - The \"correct\" chat is now always returned from returned messages. - ``to_id`` was not validated when retrieving messages by their IDs. - ``'__'`` is no longer considered valid in usernames. - The ``fd`` is removed from the reader upon closing the socket. This should be noticeable in Windows. - :tl:`MessageEmpty` is now handled when searching messages. - Fixed a rare infinite loop bug in `client.iter_dialogs <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.iter_dialogs>` for some people. - Fixed ``TypeError`` when there is no `.sender <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.sender>`. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ - You can now delete over 100 messages at once with `client.delete_messages <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.delete_messages>`. - Signing in now accounts for ``AuthRestartError`` itself, and also handles ``PasswordHashInvalidError``. - ``__all__`` is now defined, so ``from telethon import *`` imports sane defaults (client, events and utils). This is however discouraged and should be used only in quick scripts. - ``pathlib.Path`` is now supported for downloading and uploading media. - Messages you send to yourself are now considered outgoing, unless they are forwarded. - The documentation has been updated with a brand new `asyncio` crash course to encourage you use it. You can still use the threaded version if you want though. - ``.name`` property is now properly supported when sending and downloading files. - Custom ``parse_mode``, which can now be set per-client, support :tl:`MessageEntityMentionName` so you can return those now. - The session file is saved less often, which could result in a noticeable speed-up when working with a lot of incoming updates. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - The flow for sending a request is as follows: the ``TelegramClient`` creates a ``MTProtoSender`` with a ``Connection``, and the sender starts send and receive loops. Sending a request means enqueueing it in the sender, which will eventually pack and encrypt it with its ``ConnectionState`` instead of using the entire ``Session`` instance. When the data is packed, it will be sent over the ``Connection`` and ultimately over the ``TcpClient``. - Reconnection occurs at the ``MTProtoSender`` level, and receiving responses follows a similar process, but now ``asyncio.Future`` is used for the results which are no longer part of all ``TLObject``, instead are part of the ``TLMessage`` which simplifies things. - Objects can no longer be ``content_related`` and instead subclass ``TLRequest``, making the separation of concerns easier. - The ``TelegramClient`` has been split into several mixin classes to avoid having a 3,000-lines-long file with all the methods. - More special cases in the ``MTProtoSender`` have been cleaned up, and also some attributes from the ``Session`` which didn't really belong there since they weren't being saved. - The ``telethon_generator/`` can now convert ``.tl`` files into ``.json``, mostly as a proof of concept, but it might be useful for other people. Custom Message class (v0.19.1) ============================== *Published at 2018/06/03* +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 80 | +-----------------------+ This update brings a new `telethon.tl.custom.message.Message` object! All the methods in the `telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient` that used to return a :tl:`Message` will now return this object instead, which means you can do things like the following: .. code-block:: python msg = client.send_message(chat, 'Hello!') msg.edit('Hello there!') msg.reply('Good day!') print(msg.sender) Refer to its documentation to see all you can do, again, click `telethon.tl.custom.message.Message` to go to its page. Breaking Changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - The `telethon.network.connection.common.Connection` class is now an ABC, and the old ``ConnectionMode`` is now gone. Use a specific connection (like `telethon.network.connection.tcpabridged.ConnectionTcpAbridged`) instead. Additions You can get messages by their ID with telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.get_messages 's ids parameter: .. code-block:: python message = client.get_messages(chats, ids=123) # Single message message_list = client.get_messages(chats, ids=[777, 778]) # Multiple More convenience properties for telethon.tl.custom.dialog.Dialog . New default telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.parse_mode . You can edit the media of messages that already have some media. New dark theme in the online tl reference, check it out at https://tl.telethon.dev/ . Bug fixes - Some IDs start with ``1000`` and these would be wrongly treated as channels. - Some short usernames like ``@vote`` were being ignored. - `telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.iter_messages`'s ``from_user`` was failing if no filter had been set. - `telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.iter_messages`'s ``min_id/max_id`` was being ignored by Telegram. This is now worked around. - `telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.catch_up` would fail with empty states. - `telethon.events.newmessage.NewMessage` supports ``incoming=False`` to indicate ``outgoing=True``. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ - You can now send multiple requests at once while preserving the order: .. code-block:: python from telethon.tl.functions.messages import SendMessageRequest client([SendMessageRequest(chat, 'Hello 1!'), SendMessageRequest(chat, 'Hello 2!')], ordered=True) Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - ``without rowid`` is not used in SQLite anymore. - Unboxed serialization would fail. - Different default limit for ``iter_messages`` and ``get_messages``. - Some clean-up in the ``telethon_generator/`` package. Catching up on Updates (v0.19) ============================== *Published at 2018/05/07* +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 76 | +-----------------------+ This update prepares the library for catching up with updates with the new `telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.catch_up` method. This feature needs more testing, but for now it will let you \"catch up\" on some old updates that occurred while the library was offline, and brings some new features and bug fixes. Additions Add search , filter and from_user parameters to telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.iter_messages . telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.download_file now supports a None path to return the file in memory and return its bytes . Events now have a .original_update field. Bug fixes - Fixed a race condition when receiving items from the network. - A disconnection is made when \"retries reached 0\". This hasn't been tested but it might fix the bug. - ``reply_to`` would not override :tl:`Message` object's reply value. - Add missing caption when sending :tl:`Message` with media. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ - Retry automatically on ``RpcCallFailError``. This error happened a lot when iterating over many messages, and retrying often fixes it. - Faster `telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.iter_messages` by sleeping only as much as needed. - `telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.edit_message` now supports omitting the entity if you pass a :tl:`Message`. - `telethon.events.raw.Raw` can now be filtered by type. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - The library now distinguishes between MTProto and API schemas. - :tl:`State` is now persisted to the session file. - Connection won't retry forever. - Fixed some errors and cleaned up the generation of code. - Fixed typos and enhanced some documentation in general. - Add auto-cast for :tl:`InputMessage` and :tl:`InputLocation`. Pickle-able objects (v0.18.3) ============================= *Published at 2018/04/15* Now you can use Python's ``pickle`` module to serialize ``RPCError`` and any other ``TLObject`` thanks to **@vegeta1k95**! A fix that was fairly simple, but still might be useful for many people. As a side note, the documentation at https://tl.telethon.dev now lists known ``RPCError`` for all requests, so you know what to expect. This required a major rewrite, but it was well worth it! Breaking changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - `telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.forward_messages` now returns a single item instead of a list if the input was also a single item. Additions New telethon.events.messageread.MessageRead event, to find out when and who read which messages as soon as it happens. Now you can access .chat_id on all events and .sender_id on some. Bug fixes - Possibly fix some bug regarding lost ``GzipPacked`` requests. - The library now uses the \"real\" layer 75, hopefully. - Fixed ``.entities`` name collision on updates by making it private. - ``AUTH_KEY_DUPLICATED`` is handled automatically on connection. - Markdown parser's offset uses ``match.start()`` to allow custom regex. - Some filter types (as a type) were not supported by `telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.iter_participants`. - `telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.remove_event_handler` works. - `telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.start` works on all terminals. - :tl:`InputPeerSelf` case was missing from `telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.get_input_entity`. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ - The ``parse_mode`` for messages now accepts a callable. - `telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.download_media` accepts web previews. - `telethon.tl.custom.dialog.Dialog` instances can now be casted into :tl:`InputPeer`. - Better logging when reading packages \"breaks\". - Better and more powerful ``setup.py gen`` command. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - The library won't call ``.get_dialogs()`` on entity not found. Instead, it will ``raise ValueError()`` so you can properly ``except`` it. - Several new examples and updated documentation. - ``py:obj`` is the default Sphinx's role which simplifies ``.rst`` files. - ``setup.py`` now makes use of ``python_requires``. - Events now live in separate files. - Other minor changes. Several bug fixes (v0.18.2) =========================== *Published at 2018/03/27* Just a few bug fixes before they become too many. Additions Getting an entity by its positive ID should be enough, regardless of their type (whether it's an User , a Chat or a Channel ). Although wrapping them inside a Peer is still recommended, it's not necessary. New client.edit_2fa function to change your Two Factor Authentication settings. .stringify() and string representation for custom Dialog/Draft . Bug fixes - Some bug regarding ``.get_input_peer``. - ``events.ChatAction`` wasn't picking up all the pins. - ``force_document=True`` was being ignored for albums. - Now you're able to send ``Photo`` and ``Document`` as files. - Wrong access to a member on chat forbidden error for ``.get_participants``. An empty list is returned instead. - ``me/self`` check for ``.get[_input]_entity`` has been moved up so if someone has \"me\" or \"self\" as their name they won't be retrieved. Iterator methods (v0.18.1) ========================== *Published at 2018/03/17* All the ``.get_`` methods in the ``TelegramClient`` now have a ``.iter_`` counterpart, so you can do operations while retrieving items from them. For instance, you can ``client.iter_dialogs()`` and ``break`` once you find what you're looking for instead fetching them all at once. Another big thing, you can get entities by just their positive ID. This may cause some collisions (although it's very unlikely), and you can (should) still be explicit about the type you want. However, it's a lot more convenient and less confusing. Breaking changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - The library only offers the default ``SQLiteSession`` again. See :ref:`sessions` for more on how to use a different storage from now on. Additions Events now override __str__ and implement .stringify() , just like every other TLObject does. events.ChatAction now has :meth: respond , :meth: reply and :meth: delete for the message that triggered it. :meth: client.iter_participants (and its :meth: client.get_participants counterpart) now expose the filter argument, and the returned users also expose the .participant they are. You can now use :meth: client.remove_event_handler and :meth: client.list_event_handlers similar how you could with normal updates. New properties on events.NewMessage , like .video_note and .gif to access only specific types of documents. The Draft class now exposes .text and .raw_text , as well as a new :meth: Draft.send to send it. Bug fixes - ``MessageEdited`` was ignoring ``NewMessage`` constructor arguments. - Fixes for ``Event.delete_messages`` which wouldn't handle ``MessageService``. - Bot API style IDs not working on :meth:`client.get_input_entity`. - :meth:`client.download_media` didn't support ``PhotoSize``. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ - Less RPC are made when accessing the ``.sender`` and ``.chat`` of some events (mostly those that occur in a channel). - You can send albums larger than 10 items (they will be sliced for you), as well as mixing normal files with photos. - ``TLObject`` now have Python type hints. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - Several documentation corrections. - :meth:`client.get_dialogs` is only called once again when an entity is not found to avoid flood waits. Sessions overhaul (v0.18) ========================= *Published at 2018/03/04* +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 75 | +-----------------------+ The ``Session``'s have been revisited thanks to the work of **@tulir** and they now use an `ABC <https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html>`__ so you can easily implement your own! The default will still be a ``SQLiteSession``, but you might want to use the new ``AlchemySessionContainer`` if you need. Refer to the section of the documentation on :ref:`sessions` for more. Breaking changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - ``events.MessageChanged`` doesn't exist anymore. Use the new ``events.MessageEdited`` and ``events.MessageDeleted`` instead. Additions The mentioned addition of new session types. You can omit the event type on client.add_event_handler to use Raw . You can raise StopPropagation of events if you added several of them. .get_participants() can now get up to 90,000 members from groups with 100,000 if when aggressive=True , \"bypassing\" Telegram's limit. You now can access NewMessage.Event.pattern_match . Multiple captions are now supported when sending albums. client.send_message() has an optional file= parameter, so you can do events.reply(file='/path/to/photo.jpg') and similar. Added .input_ versions to events.ChatAction . You can now access the public .client property on events . New client.forward_messages , with its own wrapper on events , called event.forward_to(...) . Bug fixes - Silly bug regarding ``client.get_me(input_peer=True)``. - ``client.send_voice_note()`` was missing some parameters. - ``client.send_file()`` plays better with streams now. - Incoming messages from bots weren't working with whitelists. - Markdown's URL regex was not accepting newlines. - Better attempt at joining background update threads. - Use the right peer type when a marked integer ID is provided. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - Resolving ``events.Raw`` is now a no-op. - Logging calls in the ``TcpClient`` to spot errors. - ``events`` resolution is postponed until you are successfully connected, so you can attach them before starting the client. - When an entity is not found, it is searched in *all* dialogs. This might not always be desirable but it's more comfortable for legitimate uses. - Some non-persisting properties from the ``Session`` have been moved out. Further easing library usage (v0.17.4) ====================================== *Published at 2018/02/24* Some new things and patches that already deserved their own release. Additions New pattern argument to NewMessage to easily filter messages. New .get_participants() convenience method to get members from chats. .send_message() now accepts a Message as the message parameter. You can now .get_entity() through exact name match instead username. Raise ProxyConnectionError instead looping forever so you can except it on your own code and behave accordingly. Bug fixes - ``.parse_username`` would fail with ``www.`` or a trailing slash. - ``events.MessageChanged`` would fail with ``UpdateDeleteMessages``. - You can now send ``b'byte strings'`` directly as files again. - ``.send_file()`` was not respecting the original captions when passing another message (or media) as the file. - Downloading media from a different data center would always log a warning for the first time. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - Use ``req_pq_multi`` instead ``req_pq`` when generating ``auth_key``. - You can use ``.get_me(input_peer=True)`` if all you need is your self ID. - New addition to the interactive client example to show peer information. - Avoid special casing ``InputPeerSelf`` on some ``NewMessage`` events, so you can always safely rely on ``.sender`` to get the right ID. New small convenience functions (v0.17.3) ========================================= *Published at 2018/02/18* More bug fixes and a few others addition to make events easier to use. Additions Use hachoir to extract video and audio metadata before upload. New .add_event_handler , .add_update_handler now deprecated. Bug fixes - ``bot_token`` wouldn't work on ``.start()``, and changes to ``password`` (now it will ask you for it if you don't provide it, as docstring hinted). - ``.edit_message()`` was ignoring the formatting (e.g. markdown). - Added missing case to the ``NewMessage`` event for normal groups. - Accessing the ``.text`` of the ``NewMessage`` event was failing due to a bug with the markdown unparser. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - ``libssl`` is no longer an optional dependency. Use ``cryptg`` instead, which you can find on https://pypi.org/project/cryptg/. New small convenience functions (v0.17.2) ========================================= *Published at 2018/02/15* Primarily bug fixing and a few welcomed additions. Additions New convenience .edit_message() method on the TelegramClient . New .edit() and .delete() shorthands on the NewMessage event. Default to markdown parsing when sending and editing messages. Support for inline mentions when sending and editing messages. They work like inline urls (e.g. [text](@username) ) and also support the Bot-API style (see here <https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#formatting-options> __). Bug fixes - Periodically send ``GetStateRequest`` automatically to keep the server sending updates even if you're not invoking any request yourself. - HTML parsing was failing due to not handling surrogates properly. - ``.sign_up`` was not accepting ``int`` codes. - Whitelisting more than one chat on ``events`` wasn't working. - Video files are sent as a video by default unless ``force_document``. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - More ``logging`` calls to help spot some bugs in the future. - Some more logic to retrieve input entities on events. - Clarified a few parts of the documentation. Updates as Events (v0.17.1) =========================== *Published at 2018/02/09* Of course there was more work to be done regarding updates, and it's here! The library comes with a new ``events`` module (which you will often import as ``from telethon import TelegramClient, events``). This are pretty much all the additions that come with this version change, but they are a nice addition. Refer to *(removed broken link)* to get started with events. Trust the Server with Updates (v0.17) ===================================== *Published at 2018/02/03* The library trusts the server with updates again. The library will *not* check for duplicates anymore, and when the server kicks us, it will run ``GetStateRequest`` so the server starts sending updates again (something it wouldn't do unless you invoked something, it seems). But this update also brings a few more changes! Additions TLObject 's override __eq__ and __ne__ , so you can compare them. Added some missing cases on .get_input_entity() and peer functions. obj.to_dict() now has a '_' key with the type used. .start() can also sign up now. More parameters for .get_message_history() . Updated list of RPC errors. HTML parsing thanks to @tulir ! It can be used similar to markdown: client.send_message(..., parse_mode='html') . Enhancements - ``client.send_file()`` now accepts ``Message``'s and ``MessageMedia``'s as the ``file`` parameter. - Some documentation updates and fixed to clarify certain things. - New exact match feature on https://tl.telethon.dev. - Return as early as possible from ``.get_input_entity()`` and similar, to avoid penalizing you for doing this right. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ - ``.download_media()`` wouldn't accept a ``Document`` as parameter. - The SQLite is now closed properly on disconnection. - IPv6 addresses shouldn't use square braces. - Fix regarding ``.log_out()``. - The time offset wasn't being used (so having wrong system time would cause the library not to work at all). New ``.resolve()`` method (v0.16.2) =================================== *Published at 2018/01/19* The ``TLObject``'s (instances returned by the API and ``Request``'s) have now acquired a new ``.resolve()`` method. While this should be used by the library alone (when invoking a request), it means that you can now use ``Peer`` types or even usernames where a ``InputPeer`` is required. The object now has access to the ``client``, so that it can fetch the right type if needed, or access the session database. Furthermore, you can reuse requests that need \"autocast\" (e.g. you put :tl:`User` but ``InputPeer`` was needed), since ``.resolve()`` is called when invoking. Before, it was only done on object construction. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ - Album support. Just pass a list, tuple or any iterable to ``.send_file()``. Enhancements .start() asks for your phone only if required. Better file cache. All files under 10MB, once uploaded, should never be needed to be re-uploaded again, as the sent media is cached to the session. Bug fixes - ``setup.py`` now calls ``gen_tl`` when installing the library if needed. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - The mentioned ``.resolve()`` to perform \"autocast\", more powerful. - Upload and download methods are no longer part of ``TelegramBareClient``. - Reuse ``.on_response()``, ``.__str__`` and ``.stringify()``. Only override ``.on_response()`` if necessary (small amount of cases). - Reduced \"autocast\" overhead as much as possible. You shouldn't be penalized if you've provided the right type. MtProto 2.0 (v0.16.1) ===================== *Published at 2018/01/11* +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 74 | +-----------------------+ The library is now using MtProto 2.0! This shouldn't really affect you as an end user, but at least it means the library will be ready by the time MtProto 1.0 is deprecated. Additions New .start() method, to make the library avoid boilerplate code. .send_file accepts a new optional thumbnail parameter, and returns the Message with the sent file. Bug fixes - The library uses again only a single connection. Less updates are be dropped now, and the performance is even better than using temporary connections. - ``without rowid`` will only be used on the ``*.session`` if supported. - Phone code hash is associated with phone, so you can change your mind when calling ``.sign_in()``. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - File cache now relies on the hash of the file uploaded instead its path, and is now persistent in the ``*.session`` file. Report any bugs on this! - Clearer error when invoking without being connected. - Markdown parser doesn't work on bytes anymore (which makes it cleaner). Sessions as sqlite databases (v0.16) ==================================== *Published at 2017/12/28* In the beginning, session files used to be pickle. This proved to be bad as soon as one wanted to add more fields. For this reason, they were migrated to use JSON instead. But this proved to be bad as soon as one wanted to save things like entities (usernames, their ID and hash), so now it properly uses `sqlite3 <https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html>`__, which has been well tested, to save the session files! Calling ``.get_input_entity`` using a ``username`` no longer will need to fetch it first, so it's really 0 calls again. Calling ``.get_entity`` will always fetch the most up to date version. Furthermore, nearly everything has been documented, thus preparing the library for `Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org/>`__ (although there are a few things missing I'd like to polish first), and the `logging <https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html>`__ are now better placed. Breaking changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - ``.get_dialogs()`` now returns a **single list** instead a tuple consisting of a **custom class** that should make everything easier to work with. - ``.get_message_history()`` also returns a **single list** instead a tuple, with the ``Message`` instances modified to make them more convenient. Both lists have a ``.total`` attribute so you can still know how many dialogs/messages are in total. Additions The mentioned use of sqlite3 for the session file. .get_entity() now supports lists too, and it will make as little API calls as possible if you feed it InputPeer types. Usernames will always be resolved, since they may have changed. .set_proxy() method, to avoid having to create a new TelegramClient . More date types supported to represent a date parameter. Bug fixes - Empty strings weren't working when they were a flag parameter (e.g., setting no last name). - Fix invalid assertion regarding flag parameters as well. - Avoid joining the background thread on disconnect, as it would be `None` due to a race condition. - Correctly handle `None` dates when downloading media. - ``.download_profile_photo`` was failing for some channels. - ``.download_media`` wasn't handling ``Photo``. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - ``date`` was being serialized as local date, but that was wrong. - ``date`` was being represented as a ``float`` instead of an ``int``. - ``.tl`` parser wasn't stripping inline comments. - Removed some redundant checks on ``update_state.py``. - Use a `synchronized queue <https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html>`__ instead a hand crafted version. - Use signed integers consistently (e.g. ``salt``). - Always read the corresponding ``TLObject`` from API responses, except for some special cases still. - A few more ``except`` low level to correctly wrap errors. - More accurate exception types. - ``invokeWithLayer(initConnection(X))`` now wraps every first request after ``.connect()``. As always, report if you have issues with some of the changes! IPv6 support (v0.15.5) ====================== *Published at 2017/11/16* +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 73 | +-----------------------+ It's here, it has come! The library now **supports IPv6**! Just pass ``use_ipv6=True`` when creating a ``TelegramClient``. Note that I could *not* test this feature because my machine doesn't have IPv6 setup. If you know IPv6 works in your machine but the library doesn't, please refer to `#425 <https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/issues/425>`_. Additions IPv6 support. New method to extract the text surrounded by MessageEntity \\ 's, in the extensions.markdown module. Enhancements - Markdown parsing is Done Right. - Reconnection on failed invoke. Should avoid \"number of retries reached 0\" (#270). - Some missing autocast to ``Input*`` types. - The library uses the ``NullHandler`` for ``logging`` as it should have always done. - ``TcpClient.is_connected()`` is now more reliable. .. bug-fixes-1: Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ - Getting an entity using their phone wasn't actually working. - Full entities aren't saved unless they have an ``access_hash``, to avoid some `None` errors. - ``.get_message_history`` was failing when retrieving items that had messages forwarded from a channel. General enhancements (v0.15.4) ============================== *Published at 2017/11/04* +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 72 | +-----------------------+ This update brings a few general enhancements that are enough to deserve a new release, with a new feature: beta **markdown-like parsing** for ``.send_message()``! .. additions-1: Additions ~~~~~~~~~ - ``.send_message()`` supports ``parse_mode='md'`` for **Markdown**! It works in a similar fashion to the official clients (defaults to double underscore/asterisk, like ``**this**``). Please report any issues with emojies or enhancements for the parser! - New ``.idle()`` method so your main thread can do useful job (listen for updates). - Add missing ``.to_dict()``, ``__str__`` and ``.stringify()`` for ``TLMessage`` and ``MessageContainer``. .. bug-fixes-2: Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ - The list of known peers could end \"corrupted\" and have users with ``access_hash=None``, resulting in ``struct`` error for it not being an integer. You shouldn't encounter this issue anymore. - The warning for \"added update handler but no workers set\" wasn't actually working. - ``.get_input_peer`` was ignoring a case for ``InputPeerSelf``. - There used to be an exception when logging exceptions (whoops) on update handlers. - \"Downloading contacts\" would produce strange output if they had semicolons (``;``) in their name. - Fix some cyclic imports and installing dependencies from the ``git`` repository. - Code generation was using f-strings, which are only supported on Python \u22653.6. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - The ``auth_key`` generation has been moved from ``.connect()`` to ``.invoke()``. There were some issues were ``.connect()`` failed and the ``auth_key`` was `None` so this will ensure to have a valid ``auth_key`` when needed, even if ``BrokenAuthKeyError`` is raised. - Support for higher limits on ``.get_history()`` and ``.get_dialogs()``. - Much faster integer factorization when generating the required ``auth_key``. Thanks @delivrance for making me notice this, and for the pull request. Bug fixes with updates (v0.15.3) ================================ *Published at 2017/10/20* Hopefully a very ungrateful bug has been removed. When you used to invoke some request through update handlers, it could potentially enter an infinite loop. This has been mitigated and it's now safe to invoke things again! A lot of updates were being dropped (all those gzipped), and this has been fixed too. More bug fixes include a `correct parsing <https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/commit/ee01724cdb7027c1e38625d31446ba1ea7bade92>`__ of certain TLObjects thanks to @stek29, and `some <https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/commit/ed77ba6f8ff115ac624f02f691c9991e5b37be60>`__ `wrong calls <https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/commit/16cf94c9add5e94d70c4eee2ac142d8e76af48b9>`__ that would cause the library to crash thanks to @andr-04, and the ``ReadThread`` not re-starting if you were already authorized. Internally, the ``.to_bytes()`` function has been replaced with ``__bytes__`` so now you can do ``bytes(tlobject)``. Bug fixes and new small features (v0.15.2) ========================================== *Published at 2017/10/14* This release primarly focuses on a few bug fixes and enhancements. Although more stuff may have broken along the way. Enhancements You will be warned if you call .add_update_handler with no update_workers . New customizable threshold value on the session to determine when to automatically sleep on flood waits. See client.session.flood_sleep_threshold . New .get_drafts() method with a custom Draft class by @JosXa . Join all threads when calling .disconnect() , to assert no dangling thread is left alive. Larger chunk when downloading files should result in faster downloads. You can use a callable key for the EntityDatabase , so it can be any filter you need. .. bug-fixes-3: Bug fixes - ``.get_input_entity`` was failing for IDs and other cases, also making more requests than it should. - Use ``basename`` instead ``abspath`` when sending a file. You can now also override the attributes. - ``EntityDatabase.__delitem__`` wasn't working. - ``.send_message()`` was failing with channels. - ``.get_dialogs(limit=None)`` should now return all the dialogs correctly. - Temporary fix for abusive duplicated updates. .. enhancements-1: .. internal-changes-1: Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - MsgsAck is now sent in a container rather than its own request. - ``.get_input_photo`` is now used in the generated code. - ``.process_entities`` was being called from more places than only ``__call__``. - ``MtProtoSender`` now relies more on the generated code to read responses. Custom Entity Database (v0.15.1) ================================ *Published at 2017/10/05* The main feature of this release is that Telethon now has a custom database for all the entities you encounter, instead depending on ``@lru_cache`` on the ``.get_entity()`` method. The ``EntityDatabase`` will, by default, **cache** all the users, chats and channels you find in memory for as long as the program is running. The session will, by default, save all key-value pairs of the entity identifiers and their hashes (since Telegram may send an ID that it thinks you already know about, we need to save this information). You can **prevent** the ``EntityDatabase`` from saving users by setting ``client.session.entities.enabled = False``, and prevent the ``Session`` from saving input entities at all by setting ``client.session.save_entities = False``. You can also clear the cache for a certain user through ``client.session.entities.clear_cache(entity=None)``, which will clear all if no entity is given. Additions New method to .delete_messages() . New ChannelPrivateError class. Enhancements - ``.sign_in`` accepts phones as integers. - Changing the IP to which you connect to is as simple as ``client.session.server_address = 'ip'``, since now the server address is always queried from the session. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ - ``.get_dialogs()`` doesn't fail on Windows anymore, and returns the right amount of dialogs. - ``GeneralProxyError`` should be passed to the main thread again, so that you can handle it. Updates Overhaul Update (v0.15) =============================== *Published at 2017/10/01* After hundreds of lines changed on a major refactor, *it's finally here*. It's the **Updates Overhaul Update**; let's get right into it! Breaking changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - ``.create_new_connection()`` is gone for good. No need to deal with this manually since new connections are now handled on demand by the library itself. Enhancements You can invoke requests from update handlers . And any other thread . A new temporary will be made, so that you can be sending even several requests at the same time! Several worker threads for your updates! By default, None will spawn. I recommend you to work with update_workers=4 to get started, these will be polling constantly for updates. You can also change the number of workers at any given time. The library can now run in a single thread again, if you don't need to spawn any at all. Simply set spawn_read_thread=False when creating the TelegramClient ! You can specify limit=None on .get_dialogs() to get all of them[1]. Updates are expanded , so you don't need to check if the update has .updates or an inner .update anymore. All InputPeer entities are saved in the session file, but you can disable this by setting save_entities=False . New .get_input_entity method, which makes use of the above feature. You should use this when a request needs a InputPeer , rather than the whole entity (although both work). Assert that either all or None dependent-flag parameters are set before sending the request. Phone numbers can have dashes, spaces, or parenthesis. They'll be removed before making the request. You can override the phone and its hash on .sign_in() , if you're creating a new TelegramClient on two different places. Bug fixes - ``.log_out()`` was consuming all retries. It should work just fine now. - The session would fail to load if the ``auth_key`` had been removed manually. - ``Updates.check_error`` was popping wrong side, although it's been completely removed. - ``ServerError``\\ 's will be **ignored**, and the request will immediately be retried. - Cross-thread safety when saving the session file. - Some things changed on a matter of when to reconnect, so please report any bugs! .. internal-changes-2: Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - ``TelegramClient`` is now only an abstraction over the ``TelegramBareClient``, which can only do basic things, such as invoking requests, working with files, etc. If you don't need any of the abstractions the ``TelegramClient``, you can now use the ``TelegramBareClient`` in a much more comfortable way. - ``MtProtoSender`` is not thread-safe, but it doesn't need to be since a new connection will be spawned when needed. - New connections used to be cached and then reused. Now only their sessions are saved, as temporary connections are spawned only when needed. - Added more RPC errors to the list. **[1]:** Broken due to a condition which should had been the opposite (sigh), fixed 4 commits ahead on https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/commit/62ea77cbeac7c42bfac85aa8766a1b5b35e3a76c. -------------- **That's pretty much it**, although there's more work to be done to make the overall experience of working with updates *even better*. Stay tuned! Serialization bug fixes (v0.14.2) ================================= *Published at 2017/09/29* Bug fixes Important , related to the serialization. Every object or request that had to serialize a True/False type was always being serialized as false ! Another bug that didn't allow you to leave as None flag parameters that needed a list has been fixed. Internal changes - Other internal changes include a somewhat more readable ``.to_bytes()`` function and pre-computing the flag instead using bit shifting. The ``TLObject.constructor_id`` has been renamed to ``TLObject.CONSTRUCTOR_ID``, and ``.subclass_of_id`` is also uppercase now. Farewell, BinaryWriter (v0.14.1) ================================ *Published at 2017/09/28* Version ``v0.14`` had started working on the new ``.to_bytes()`` method to dump the ``BinaryWriter`` and its usage on the ``.on_send()`` when serializing TLObjects, and this release finally removes it. The speed up when serializing things to bytes should now be over twice as fast wherever it's needed. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ - This version is again compatible with Python 3.x versions **below 3.5** (there was a method call that was Python 3.5 and above). Internal changes Using proper classes (including the generated code) for generating authorization keys and to write out TLMessage \\ 's. Several requests at once and upload compression (v0.14) \u00b6 Published at 2017/09/27 New major release, since I've decided that these two features are big enough: Additions - Requests larger than 512 bytes will be **compressed through gzip**, and if the result is smaller, this will be uploaded instead. - You can now send **multiple requests at once**, they're simply ``*var_args`` on the ``.invoke()``. Note that the server doesn't guarantee the order in which they'll be executed! Internally, another important change. The ``.on_send`` function on the ``TLObjects`` is **gone**, and now there's a new ``.to_bytes()``. From my tests, this has always been over twice as fast serializing objects, although more replacements need to be done, so please report any issues. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ - Implemented ``.get_input_media`` helper methods. Now you can even use another message as input media! Bug fixes Downloading media from CDNs wasn't working (wrong access to a parameter). Correct type hinting. Added a tiny sleep when trying to perform automatic reconnection. Error reporting is done in the background, and has a shorter timeout. setup.py used to fail with wrongly generated code. Quick fix-up (v0.13.6) \u00b6 Published at 2017/09/23 Before getting any further, here's a quick fix-up with things that should have been on v0.13.5 but were missed. Specifically, the timeout when receiving a request will now work properly. Some other additions are a tiny fix when handling updates , which was ignoring some of them, nicer __str__ and .stringify() methods for the TLObject \\ 's, and not stopping the ReadThread if you try invoking something there (now it simply returns None ). Attempts at more stability (v0.13.5) \u00b6 Published at 2017/09/23 Yet another update to fix some bugs and increase the stability of the library, or, at least, that was the attempt! This release should really improve the experience with the background thread that the library starts to read things from the network as soon as it can, but I can't spot every use case, so please report any bug (and as always, minimal reproducible use cases will help a lot). .. bug-fixes-4: Bug fixes - ``setup.py`` was failing on Python < 3.5 due to some imports. - Duplicated updates should now be ignored. - ``.send_message`` would crash in some cases, due to having a typo using the wrong object. - ``\"socket is None\"`` when calling ``.connect()`` should not happen anymore. - ``BrokenPipeError`` was still being raised due to an incorrect order on the ``try/except`` block. .. enhancements-2: Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ - **Type hinting** for all the generated ``Request``\\ 's and ``TLObjects``! IDEs like PyCharm will benefit from this. - ``ProxyConnectionError`` should properly be passed to the main thread for you to handle. - The background thread will only be started after you're authorized on Telegram (i.e. logged in), and several other attempts at polishing the experience with this thread. - The ``Connection`` instance is only created once now, and reused later. - Calling ``.connect()`` should have a better behavior now (like actually *trying* to connect even if we seemingly were connected already). - ``.reconnect()`` behavior has been changed to also be more consistent by making the assumption that we'll only reconnect if the server has disconnected us, and is now private. .. other-changes-1: Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - ``TLObject.__repr__`` doesn't show the original TL definition anymore, it was a lot of clutter. If you have any complaints open an issue and we can discuss it. - Internally, the ``'+'`` from the phone number is now stripped, since it shouldn't be included. - Spotted a new place where ``BrokenAuthKeyError`` would be raised, and it now is raised there. More bug fixes and enhancements (v0.13.4) ========================================= *Published at 2017/09/18* .. new-stuff-1: Additions TelegramClient now exposes a .is_connected() method. Initial authorization on a new data center will retry up to 5 times by default. Errors that couldn't be handled on the background thread will be raised on the next call to .invoke() or updates.poll() . .. bugs-fixed-1: Bug fixes - Now you should be able to sign in even if you have ``process_updates=True`` and no previous session. - Some errors and methods are documented a bit clearer. - ``.send_message()`` could randomly fail, as the returned type was not expected. - ``TimeoutError`` is now ignored, since the request will be retried up to 5 times by default. - \"-404\" errors (``BrokenAuthKeyError``\\ 's) are now detected when first connecting to a new data center. - ``BufferError`` is handled more gracefully, in the same way as ``InvalidCheckSumError``\\ 's. - Attempt at fixing some \"NoneType has no attribute\u2026\" errors (with the ``.sender``). Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - Calling ``GetConfigRequest`` is now made less often. - The ``initial_query`` parameter from ``.connect()`` is gone, as it's not needed anymore. - Renamed ``all_tlobjects.layer`` to ``all_tlobjects.LAYER`` (since it's a constant). - The message from ``BufferError`` is now more useful. Bug fixes and enhancements (v0.13.3) ==================================== *Published at 2017/09/14* .. bugs-fixed-2: Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ - **Reconnection** used to fail because it tried invoking things from the ``ReadThread``. - Inferring **random ids** for ``ForwardMessagesRequest`` wasn't working. - Downloading media from **CDNs** failed due to having forgotten to remove a single line. - ``TcpClient.close()`` now has a **``threading.Lock``**, so ``NoneType has no close()`` should not happen. - New **workaround** for ``msg seqno too low/high``. Also, both ``Session.id/seq`` are not saved anymore. .. enhancements-3: Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ - **Request will be retried** up to 5 times by default rather than failing on the first attempt. - ``InvalidChecksumError``\\ 's are now **ignored** by the library. - ``TelegramClient.get_entity()`` is now **public**, and uses the ``@lru_cache()`` decorator. - New method to **``.send_voice_note()``**\\ 's. - Methods to send message and media now support a **``reply_to`` parameter**. - ``.send_message()`` now returns the **full message** which was just sent. New way to work with updates (v0.13.2) ====================================== *Published at 2017/09/08* This update brings a new way to work with updates, and it's begging for your **feedback**, or better names or ways to do what you can do now. Please refer to the `wiki/Usage Modes <https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/wiki/Usage-Modes>`__ for an in-depth description on how to work with updates now. Notice that you cannot invoke requests from within handlers anymore, only the ``v.0.13.1`` patch allowed you to do so. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ - Periodic pings are back. - The username regex mentioned on ``UsernameInvalidError`` was invalid, but it has now been fixed. - Sending a message to a phone number was failing because the type used for a request had changed on layer 71. - CDN downloads weren't working properly, and now a few patches have been applied to ensure more reliability, although I couldn't personally test this, so again, report any feedback. Invoke other requests from within update callbacks (v0.13.1) ============================================================ *Published at 2017/09/04* .. warning:: This update brings some big changes to the update system, so please read it if you work with them! A silly \"bug\" which hadn't been spotted has now been fixed. Now you can invoke other requests from within your update callbacks. However **this is not advised**. You should post these updates to some other thread, and let that thread do the job instead. Invoking a request from within a callback will mean that, while this request is being invoked, no other things will be read. Internally, the generated code now resides under a *lot* less files, simply for the sake of avoiding so many unnecessary files. The generated code is not meant to be read by anyone, simply to do its job. Unused attributes have been removed from the ``TLObject`` class too, and ``.sign_up()`` returns the user that just logged in in a similar way to ``.sign_in()`` now. Connection modes (v0.13) ======================== *Published at 2017/09/04* +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 71 | +-----------------------+ The purpose of this release is to denote a big change, now you can connect to Telegram through different `**connection modes** <https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/blob/v0.13/telethon/network/connection.py>`__. Also, a **second thread** will *always* be started when you connect a ``TelegramClient``, despite whether you'll be handling updates or ignoring them, whose sole purpose is to constantly read from the network. The reason for this change is as simple as *\"reading and writing shouldn't be related\"*. Even when you're simply ignoring updates, this way, once you send a request you will only need to read the result for the request. Whatever Telegram sent before has already been read and outside the buffer. .. additions-2: Additions ~~~~~~~~~ - The mentioned different connection modes, and a new thread. - You can modify the ``Session`` attributes through the ``TelegramClient`` constructor (using ``**kwargs``). - ``RPCError``\\ 's now belong to some request you've made, which makes more sense. - ``get_input_*`` now handles `None` (default) parameters more gracefully (it used to crash). .. enhancements-4: Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ - The low-level socket doesn't use a handcrafted timeout anymore, which should benefit by avoiding the arbitrary ``sleep(0.1)`` that there used to be. - ``TelegramClient.sign_in`` will call ``.send_code_request`` if no ``code`` was provided. Deprecation ~~~~~~~~~~~ - ``.sign_up`` does *not* take a ``phone`` argument anymore. Change this or you will be using ``phone`` as ``code``, and it will fail! The definition looks like ``def sign_up(self, code, first_name, last_name='')``. - The old ``JsonSession`` finally replaces the original ``Session`` (which used pickle). If you were overriding any of these, you should only worry about overriding ``Session`` now. Added verification for CDN file (v0.12.2) ========================================= *Published at 2017/08/28* Since the Content Distributed Network (CDN) is not handled by Telegram itself, the owners may tamper these files. Telegram sends their sha256 sum for clients to implement this additional verification step, which now the library has. If any CDN has altered the file you're trying to download, ``CdnFileTamperedError`` will be raised to let you know. Besides this. ``TLObject.stringify()`` was showing bytes as lists (now fixed) and RPC errors are reported by default: In an attempt to help everyone who works with the Telegram API, Telethon will by default report all Remote Procedure Call errors to `PWRTelegram <https://pwrtelegram.xyz/>`__, a public database anyone can query, made by `Daniil <https://github.com/danog>`__. All the information sent is a GET request with the error code, error message and method used. .. note:: If you still would like to opt out, simply set ``client.session.report_errors = False`` to disable this feature. However Daniil would really thank you if you helped him (and everyone) by keeping it on! CDN support (v0.12.1) ===================== *Published at 2017/08/24* The biggest news for this update are that downloading media from CDN's (you'll often encounter this when working with popular channels) now **works**. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ - The method used to download documents crashed because two lines were swapped. - Determining the right path when downloading any file was very weird, now it's been enhanced. - The ``.sign_in()`` method didn't support integer values for the code! Now it does again. Some important internal changes are that the old way to deal with RSA public keys now uses a different module instead the old strange hand-crafted version. Hope the new, super simple ``README.rst`` encourages people to use Telethon and make it better with either suggestions, or pull request. Pull requests are *super* appreciated, but showing some support by leaving a star also feels nice \u2b50\ufe0f. Newbie friendly update (v0.12) ============================== *Published at 2017/08/22* +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 70 | +-----------------------+ This update is overall an attempt to make Telethon a bit more user friendly, along with some other stability enhancements, although it brings quite a few changes. Breaking changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - The ``TelegramClient`` methods ``.send_photo_file()``, ``.send_document_file()`` and ``.send_media_file()`` are now a **single method** called ``.send_file()``. It's also important to note that the **order** of the parameters has been **swapped**: first to *who* you want to send it, then the file itself. - The same applies to ``.download_msg_media()``, which has been renamed to ``.download_media()``. The method now supports a ``Message`` itself too, rather than only ``Message.media``. The specialized ``.download_photo()``, ``.download_document()`` and ``.download_contact()`` still exist, but are private. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ - Updated to **layer 70**! - Both downloading and uploading now support **stream-like objects**. - A lot **faster initial connection** if ``sympy`` is installed (can be installed through ``pip``). - ``libssl`` will also be used if available on your system (likely on Linux based systems). This speed boost should also apply to uploading and downloading files. - You can use a **phone number** or an **username** for methods like ``.send_message()``, ``.send_file()``, and all the other quick-access methods provided by the ``TelegramClient``. .. bug-fixes-5: Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ - Crashing when migrating to a new layer and receiving old updates should not happen now. - ``InputPeerChannel`` is now casted to ``InputChannel`` automtically too. - ``.get_new_msg_id()`` should now be thread-safe. No promises. - Logging out on macOS caused a crash, which should be gone now. - More checks to ensure that the connection is flagged correctly as either connected or not. .. note:: Downloading files from CDN's will **not work** yet (something new that comes with layer 70). -------------- That's it, any new idea or suggestion about how to make the project even more friendly is highly appreciated. .. note:: Did you know that you can pretty print any result Telegram returns (called ``TLObject``\\ 's) by using their ``.stringify()`` function? Great for debugging! get_input_* now works with vectors (v0.11.5) ============================================= *Published at 2017/07/11* Quick fix-up of a bug which hadn't been encountered until now. Auto-cast by using ``get_input_*`` now works. get_input_* everywhere (v0.11.4) ================================= *Published at 2017/07/10* For some reason, Telegram doesn't have enough with the `InputPeer <https://tl.telethon.dev/types/input_peer.html>`__. There also exist `InputChannel <https://tl.telethon.dev/types/input_channel.html>`__ and `InputUser <https://tl.telethon.dev/types/input_user.html>`__! You don't have to worry about those anymore, it's handled internally now. Besides this, every Telegram object now features a new default ``.__str__`` look, and also a `.stringify() method <https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/commit/8fd0d7eadd944ff42e18aaf06228adc7aba794b5>`__ to pretty format them, if you ever need to inspect them. The library now uses `the DEBUG level <https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/commit/1f7ac7118750ed84e2165dce9c6aca2e6ea0c6a4>`__ everywhere, so no more warnings or information messages if you had logging enabled. The ``no_webpage`` parameter from ``.send_message`` `has been renamed <https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/commit/0119a006585acd1a1a9a8901a21bb2f193142cfe>`__ to ``link_preview`` for clarity, so now it does the opposite (but has a clearer intention). Quick .send_message() fix (v0.11.3) =================================== *Published at 2017/07/05* A very quick follow-up release to fix a tiny bug with ``.send_message()``, no new features. Callable TelegramClient (v0.11.2) ================================= *Published at 2017/07/04* +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 68 | +-----------------------+ There is a new preferred way to **invoke requests**, which you're encouraged to use: .. code:: python # New! result = client(SomeRequest()) # Old. result = client.invoke(SomeRequest()) Existing code will continue working, since the old ``.invoke()`` has not been deprecated. When you ``.create_new_connection()``, it will also handle ``FileMigrateError``\\ 's for you, so you don't need to worry about those anymore. .. bugs-fixed-3: Bugs fixes Fixed some errors when installing Telethon via pip (for those using either source distributions or a Python version \u2264 3.5). ConnectionResetError didn't flag sockets as closed, but now it does. On a more technical side, msg_id \\ 's are now more accurate. Improvements to the updates (v0.11.1) \u00b6 Published at 2017/06/24 Receiving new updates shouldn't miss any anymore, also, periodic pings are back again so it should work on the long run. On a different order of things, .connect() also features a timeout. Notice that the timeout= is not passed as a parameter anymore, and is instead specified when creating the TelegramClient . Bug fixes - Fixed some name class when a request had a ``.msg_id`` parameter. - The correct amount of random bytes is now used in DH request - Fixed ``CONNECTION_APP_VERSION_EMPTY`` when using temporary sessions. - Avoid connecting if already connected. Support for parallel connections (v0.11) ======================================== *Published at 2017/06/16* *This update brings a lot of changes, so it would be nice if you could* **read the whole change log**! Breaking changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - Every Telegram error has now its **own class**, so it's easier to fine-tune your ``except``\\ 's. - Markdown parsing is **not part** of Telethon itself anymore, although there are plans to support it again through a some external module. - The ``.list_sessions()`` has been moved to the ``Session`` class instead. - The ``InteractiveTelegramClient`` is **not** shipped with ``pip`` anymore. Additions A new, more lightweight class has been added. The TelegramBareClient is now the base of the normal TelegramClient , and has the most basic features. New method to .create_new_connection() , which can be ran in parallel with the original connection. This will return the previously mentioned TelegramBareClient already connected. Any file object can now be used to download a file (for instance, a BytesIO() instead a file name). Vales like random_id are now automatically inferred , so you can save yourself from the hassle of writing generate_random_long() everywhere. Same applies to .get_input_peer() , unless you really need the extra performance provided by skipping one if if called manually. Every type now features a new .to_dict() method. .. bug-fixes-6: Bug fixes - Received errors are acknowledged to the server, so they don't happen over and over. - Downloading media on different data centers is now up to **x2 faster**, since there used to be an ``InvalidDCError`` for each file part tried to be downloaded. - Lost messages are now properly skipped. - New way to handle the **result of requests**. The old ``ValueError`` \"*The previously sent request must be resent. However, no request was previously sent (possibly called from a different thread).*\" *should* not happen anymore. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - Some fixes to the ``JsonSession``. - Fixed possibly crashes if trying to ``.invoke()`` a ``Request`` while ``.reconnect()`` was being called on the ``UpdatesThread``. - Some improvements on the ``TcpClient``, such as not switching between blocking and non-blocking sockets. - The code now uses ASCII characters only. - Some enhancements to ``.find_user_or_chat()`` and ``.get_input_peer()``. JSON session file (v0.10.1) =========================== *Published at 2017/06/07* This version is primarily for people to **migrate** their ``.session`` files, which are *pickled*, to the new *JSON* format. Although slightly slower, and a bit more vulnerable since it's plain text, it's a lot more resistant to upgrades. .. warning:: You **must** upgrade to this version before any higher one if you've used Telethon \u2264 v0.10. If you happen to upgrade to an higher version, that's okay, but you will have to manually delete the ``*.session`` file, and logout from that session from an official client. Additions New .get_me() function to get the current user. .is_user_authorized() is now more reliable. New nice button to copy the from telethon.tl.xxx.yyy import Yyy on the online documentation. More error codes added to the errors file. Enhancements - Everything on the documentation is now, theoretically, **sorted alphabetically**. - No second thread is spawned unless one or more update handlers are added. Full support for different DCs and ++stable (v0.10) =================================================== *Published at 2017/06/03* Working with **different data centers** finally *works*! On a different order of things, **reconnection** is now performed automatically every time Telegram decides to kick us off their servers, so now Telethon can really run **forever and ever**! In theory. Enhancements Documentation improvements, such as showing the return type. The msg_id too low/high error should happen less often , if any. Sleeping on the main thread is not done anymore . You will have to except FloodWaitError \\ 's. You can now specify your own application version , device model, system version and language code. Code is now more pythonic (such as making some members private), and other internal improvements (which affect the updates thread ), such as using logger instead a bare print() too. This brings Telethon a whole step closer to v1.0 , though more things should preferably be changed. Stability improvements (v0.9.1) \u00b6 Published at 2017/05/23 Telethon used to crash a lot when logging in for the very first time. The reason for this was that the reconnection (or dead connections) were not handled properly. Now they are, so you should be able to login directly, without needing to delete the *.session file anymore. Notice that downloading from a different DC is still a WIP. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Updates thread is only started after a successful login. Files meant to be ran by the user now use shebangs and proper permissions. In-code documentation now shows the returning type. Relative import is now used everywhere, so you can rename telethon to anything else. Dead connections are now detected instead entering an infinite loop. Sockets can now be closed (and re-opened) properly. Telegram decided to update the layer 66 without increasing the number. This has been fixed and now we're up-to-date again. General improvements (v0.9) \u00b6 Published at 2017/05/19 +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 66 | +-----------------------+ Additions ~~~~~~~~~ The documentation , available online here <https://tl.telethon.dev/> __, has a new search bar. Better cross-thread safety by using threading.Event . More improvements for running Telethon during a long period of time . Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ Avoid a certain crash on login (occurred if an unexpected object ID was received). Avoid crashing with certain invalid UTF-8 strings. Avoid crashing on certain terminals by using known ASCII characters where possible. The UpdatesThread is now a daemon, and should cause less issues. Temporary sessions didn't actually work (with session=None ). Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ .get_dialogs(count= was renamed to .get_dialogs(limit= . Bot login and proxy support (v0.8) \u00b6 Published at 2017/04/14 Additions ~~~~~~~~~ Bot login , thanks to @JuanPotato for hinting me about how to do it. Proxy support , thanks to @exzhawk for implementing it. Logging support , used by passing --telethon-log=DEBUG (or INFO ) as a command line argument. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ Connection fixes, such as avoiding connection until .connect() is explicitly invoked. Uploading big files now works correctly. Fix uploading big files. Some fixes on the updates thread, such as correctly sleeping when required. Long-run bug fix (v0.7.1) \u00b6 Published at 2017/02/19 If you're one of those who runs Telethon for a long time (more than 30 minutes), this update by @strayge will be great for you. It sends periodic pings to the Telegram servers so you don't get disconnected and you can still send and receive updates! Two factor authentication (v0.7) \u00b6 Published at 2017/01/31 +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 62 | +-----------------------+ If you're one of those who love security the most, these are good news. You can now use two factor authentication with Telethon too! As internal changes, the coding style has been improved, and you can easily use custom session objects, and various little bugs have been fixed. Updated pip version (v0.6) \u00b6 Published at 2016/11/13 +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 57 | +-----------------------+ This release has no new major features. However, it contains some small changes that make using Telethon a little bit easier. Now those who have installed Telethon via pip can also take advantage of changes, such as less bugs, creating empty instances of TLObjects , specifying a timeout and more! Ready, pip, go! (v0.5) \u00b6 Published at 2016/09/18 Telethon is now available as a Python package <https://pypi.python.org/pypi?name=Telethon> __ ! Those are really exciting news (except, sadly, the project structure had to change a lot to be able to do that; but hopefully it won't need to change much more, any more!) Not only that, but more improvements have also been made: you're now able to both sign up and logout , watch a pretty \"Uploading/Downloading\u2026 x%\" progress, and other minor changes which make using Telethon easier . Made InteractiveTelegramClient cool (v0.4) \u00b6 Published at 2016/09/12 Yes, really cool! I promise. Even though this is meant to be a library , that doesn't mean it can't have a good interactive client for you to try the library out. This is why now you can do many, many things with the InteractiveTelegramClient : List dialogs (chats) and pick any you wish. Send any message you like, text, photos or even documents. List the latest messages in the chat. Download any message's media (photos, documents or even contacts!). Receive message updates as you talk (i.e., someone sent you a message). It actually is an usable-enough client for your day by day. You could even add libnotify and pop, you're done! A great cli-client with desktop notifications. Also, being able to download and upload media implies that you can do the same with the library itself. Did I need to mention that? Oh, and now, with even less bugs! I hope. Media revolution and improvements to update handling! (v0.3) \u00b6 Published at 2016/09/11 Telegram is more than an application to send and receive messages. You can also send and receive media . Now, this implementation also gives you the power to upload and download media from any message that contains it! Nothing can now stop you from filling up all your disk space with all the photos! If you want to, of course. Handle updates in their own thread! (v0.2) \u00b6 Published at 2016/09/10 This version handles updates in a different thread (if you wish to do so). This means that both the low level TcpClient and the not-so-low-level MtProtoSender are now multi-thread safe, so you can use them with more than a single thread without worrying! This also implies that you won't need to send a request to receive an update (is someone typing? did they send me a message? has someone gone offline?). They will all be received instantly . Some other cool examples of things that you can do: when someone tells you \" Hello \", you can automatically reply with another \" Hello \" without even needing to type it by yourself :) However, be careful with spamming!! Do not use the program for that! First working alpha version! (v0.1) \u00b6 Published at 2016/09/06 +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 55 | +-----------------------+ There probably are some bugs left, which haven't yet been found. However, the majority of code works and the application is already usable! Not only that, but also uses the latest scheme as of now and handles way better the errors. This tag is being used to mark this release as stable enough.","title":"Changelog (Version History)"},{"location":"misc/changelog/#changelog-version-history","text":"This page lists all the available versions of the library, in chronological order.

Documentation Overhaul (v1.8) ============================= *Published at 2019/05/30* +------------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 100 | +------------------------+ The documentation has been completely reworked from the ground up, with awesome new quick references such as :ref:`client-ref` to help you quickly find what you need! Raw methods also warn you when a friendly variant is available, so that you don't accidentally make your life harder than it has to be. In addition, all methods in the client now are fully annotated with type hints! More work needs to be done, but this should already help a lot when using Telethon from any IDEs. You may have noticed that the patch versions between ``v1.7.2`` to ``v1.7.7`` have not been documented. This is because patch versions should only contain bug fixes, no new features or breaking changes. This hasn't been the case in the past, but from now on, the library will try to adhere more strictly to the `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org>`_ principles. If you ever want to look at those bug fixes, please use the appropriated ``git`` command, such as ``git shortlog v1.7.1...v1.7.4``, but in general, they probably just fixed your issue. With that out of the way, let's look at the full change set: Breaking Changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ * The layer changed, so take note if you use the raw API, as it's usual. * The way photos are downloaded changed during the layer update of the previous version, and fixing that bug as a breaking change in itself. `client.download_media() <telethon.client.downloads.DownloadMethods.download_media>` now offers a different way to deal with thumbnails. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ * New `Message.file <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.file>` property! Now you can trivially access `message.file.id <telethon.tl.custom.file.File.id>` to get the file ID of some media, or even ``print(message.file.name)``. * Archiving dialogs with `Dialog.archive() <telethon.tl.custom.dialog.Dialog.archive>` or `client.edit_folder() <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.edit_folder>` is now possible. * New cleaned-up method to stream downloads with `client.iter_download() <telethon.client.downloads.DownloadMethods.iter_download>`, which offers a lot of flexibility, such as arbitrary offsets for efficient seeking. * `Dialog.delete() <telethon.tl.custom.dialog.Dialog.delete>` has existed for a while, and now `client.delete_dialog() <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.delete_dialog>` exists too so you can easily leave chats or delete dialogs without fetching all dialogs. * Some people or chats have a lot of profile photos. You can now iterate over all of them with the new `client.iter_profile_photos() <telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.iter_profile_photos>` method. * You can now annoy everyone with the new `Message.pin(notify=True) <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.pin>`! The client has its own variant too, called `client.pin_message() <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.pin_message>`. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ * Correctly catch and raise all RPC errors. * Downloading stripped photos wouldn't work correctly. * Under some systems, ``libssl`` would fail to load earlier than expected, causing the library to fail when being imported. * `conv.get_response() <telethon.tl.custom.conversation.Conversation.get_response>` after ID 0 wasn't allowed when it should. * `InlineBuilder <telethon.tl.custom.inlinebuilder.InlineBuilder>` only worked with local files, but files from anywhere are supported. * Accessing the text property from a raw-API call to fetch :tl:`Message` would fail (any any other property that needed the client). * Database is now upgraded if the version was lower, not different. From now on, this should help with upgrades and downgrades slightly. * Fixed saving ``pts`` and session-related stuff. * Disconnection should not raise any errors. * Invite links of the form ``tg://join?invite=`` now work. * `client.iter_participants(search=...) <telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.iter_participants>` now works on private chats again. * Iterating over messages in reverse with a date as offset wouldn't work. * The conversation would behave weirdly when a timeout occurred. Enhancements telethon now re-export all the goodies that you commonly need when using the library, so e.g. from telethon import Button will now work. telethon.sync now re-exports everything from telethon , so that you can trivially import from just one place everything that you need. More attempts at reducing CPU usage after automatically fetching missing entities on events. This isn't a big deal, even if it sounds like one. Hexadecimal invite links are now supported. You didn't need them, but they will now work. Internal Changes * Deterministic code generation. This is good for ``diff``. * On Python 3.7 and above, we properly close the connection. * A lot of micro-optimization. * Fixes to bugs introduced while making this release. * Custom commands on ``setup.py`` are nicer to use. Fix-up for Photo Downloads (v1.7.1) =================================== *Published at 2019/04/24* Telegram changed the way thumbnails (which includes photos) are downloaded, so you can no longer use a :tl:`PhotoSize` alone to download a particular thumbnail size (this is a **breaking change**). Instead, you will have to specify the new ``thumb`` parameter in `client.download_media() <telethon.client.downloads.DownloadMethods.download_media>` to download a particular thumbnail size. This addition enables you to easily download thumbnails from documents, something you couldn't do easily before. Easier Events (v1.7) ==================== *Published at 2019/04/22* +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 98 | +-----------------------+ If you have been using Telethon for a while, you probably know how annoying the \"Could not find the input entity for\u2026\" error can be. In this new version, the library will try harder to find the input entity for you! That is, instead of doing: .. code-block:: python @client.on(events.NewMessage) async def handler(event): await client.download_profile_photo(await event.get_input_sender()) # ...... needs await, it's a method ^^^^^ ^^ You can now do: .. code-block:: python @client.on(events.NewMessage) async def handler(event): await client.download_profile_photo(event.input_sender) # ...... no await, it's a property! ^ # It's also 12 characters shorter :) And even the following will hopefully work: .. code-block:: python @client.on(events.NewMessage) async def handler(event): await client.download_profile_photo(event.sender_id) A lot of people use IDs thinking this is the right way of doing it. Ideally, you would always use ``input_*``, not ``sender`` or ``sender_id`` (and the same applies to chats). But, with this change, IDs will work just the same as ``input_*`` inside events. **This feature still needs some more testing**, so please do open an issue if you find strange behaviour. Breaking Changes The layer changed, and a lot of things did too. If you are using raw API, you should be careful with this. In addition, some attributes weren't of type datetime when they should be, which has been fixed. Due to the layer change, you can no longer download photos with just their :tl: PhotoSize . Version 1.7.1 introduces a new way to download thumbnails to work around this issue. client.disconnect() <telethon.client.telegrambaseclient.TelegramBaseClient.disconnect> is now asynchronous again. This means you need to await it. You don't need to worry about this if you were using with client or client.run_until_disconnected <telethon.client.updates.UpdateMethods.run_until_disconnected> . This should prevent the \"pending task was destroyed\" errors. Additions * New in-memory cache for input entities. This should mean a lot less of disk look-ups. * New `client.action <telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.action>` method to easily indicate that you are doing some chat action: .. code-block:: python async with client.action(chat, 'typing'): await asyncio.sleep(2) # type for 2 seconds await client.send_message(chat, 'Hello world! I type slow ^^') You can also easily use this for sending files, playing games, etc. New bugs ~~~~~~~~ * Downloading photos is broken. This is fixed in v1.7.1. Bug fixes Fix sending photos from streams/bytes. Fix unhandled error when sending requests that were too big. Fix edits that arrive too early on conversations. Fix client.edit_message() <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.edit_message> when trying to edit a file. Fix method calls on the objects returned by client.iter_dialogs() <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.iter_dialogs> . Attempt at fixing client.iter_dialogs() <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.iter_dialogs> missing many dialogs. offset_date in client.iter_messages() <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.iter_messages> was being ignored in some cases. This has been worked around. Fix callback_query.edit() <telethon.events.callbackquery.CallbackQuery.Event.edit> . Fix CallbackQuery(func=...) <telethon.events.callbackquery.CallbackQuery> was being ignored. Fix UserUpdate <telethon.events.userupdate.UserUpdate> not working for \"typing\" (and uploading file, etc.) status. Fix library was not expecting IOError from PySocks. Fix library was raising a generic ConnectionError and not the one that actually occurred. Fix the blacklist_chats parameter in MessageRead <telethon.events.messageread.MessageRead> not working as intended. Fix client.download_media(contact) <telethon.client.downloads.DownloadMethods.download_media> . Fix mime type when sending mp3 files. Fix forcibly getting the sender or chat from events would not always return all their information. Fix sending albums with client.send_file() <telethon.client.uploads.UploadMethods.send_file> was not returning the sent messages. Fix forwarding albums with client.forward_messages() <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.forward_messages> . Some fixes regarding filtering updates from chats. Attempt at preventing duplicated updates. Prevent double auto-reconnect. Enhancements * Some improvements related to proxy connections. * Several updates and improvements to the documentation, such as optional dependencies now being properly listed. * You can now forward messages from different chats directly with `client.forward_messages <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.forward_messages>`. Tidying up Internals (v1.6) =========================== *Published at 2019/02/27* +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 95 | +-----------------------+ First things first, sorry for updating the layer in the previous patch version. That should only be done between major versions ideally, but due to how Telegram works, it's done between minor versions. However raw API has and will always be considered \"unsafe\", this meaning that you should always use the convenience client methods instead. These methods don't cover the full API yet, so pull requests are welcome. Breaking Changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ * The layer update, of course. This didn't really need a mention here. * You can no longer pass a ``batch_size`` when iterating over messages. No other method exposed this parameter, and it was only meant for testing purposes. Instead, it's now a private constant. * ``client.iter_*`` methods no longer have a ``_total`` parameter which was supposed to be private anyway. Instead, they return a new generator object which has a ``.total`` attribute: .. code-block:: python it = client.iter_messages(chat) for i, message in enumerate(it, start=1): percentage = i / it.total print('{:.2%} {}'.format(percentage, message.text)) Additions ~~~~~~~~~ * You can now pass ``phone`` and ``phone_code_hash`` in `client.sign_up <telethon.client.auth.AuthMethods.sign_up>`, although you probably don't need that. * Thanks to the overhaul of all ``client.iter_*`` methods, you can now do: .. code-block:: python for message in reversed(client.iter_messages('me')): print(message.text) Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ * Fix `telethon.utils.resolve_bot_file_id`, which wasn't working after the layer update (so you couldn't send some files by bot file IDs). * Fix sending albums as bot file IDs (due to image detection improvements). * Fix `takeout() <telethon.client.account.AccountMethods.takeout>` failing when they need to download media from other DCs. * Fix repeatedly calling `conversation.get_response() <telethon.tl.custom.conversation.Conversation.get_response>` when many messages arrived at once (i.e. when several of them were forwarded). * Fixed connecting with `ConnectionTcpObfuscated <telethon.network.connection.tcpobfuscated.ConnectionTcpObfuscated>`. * Fix `client.get_peer_id('me') <telethon.client.users.UserMethods.get_peer_id>`. * Fix warning of \"missing sqlite3\" when in reality it just had wrong tables. * Fix a strange error when using too many IDs in `client.delete_messages() <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.delete_messages>`. * Fix `client.send_file <telethon.client.uploads.UploadMethods.send_file>` with the result of `client.upload_file <telethon.client.uploads.UploadMethods.upload_file>`. * When answering inline results, their order was not being preserved. * Fix `events.ChatAction <telethon.events.chataction.ChatAction>` detecting user leaves as if they were kicked. Enhancements Cleared up some parts of the documentation. Improved some auto-casts to make life easier. Improved image detection. Now you can easily send bytes and streams of images as photos, unless you force document. Sending images as photos that are too large will now be resized before uploading, reducing the time it takes to upload them and also avoiding errors when the image was too large (as long as pillow is installed). The images will remain unchanged if you send it as a document. Treat errors.RpcMcgetFailError as a temporary server error to automatically retry shortly. This works around most issues. Internal changes * New common way to deal with retries (``retry_range``). * Cleaned up the takeout client. * Completely overhauled asynchronous generators. Layer Update (v1.5.5) ===================== *Published at 2019/01/14* +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 93 | +-----------------------+ There isn't an entry for v1.5.4 because it contained only one hot-fix regarding loggers. This update is slightly bigger so it deserves mention. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ * New ``supports_streaming`` parameter in `client.send_file <telethon.client.uploads.UploadMethods.send_file>`. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ * Dealing with mimetypes should cause less issues in systems like Windows. * Potentially fix alternative session storages that had issues with dates. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ * Saner timeout defaults for conversations. * ``Path``-like files are now supported for thumbnails. * Added new hot-keys to the online documentation at https://tl.telethon.dev/ such as ``/`` to search. Press ``?`` to view them all. Bug Fixes (v1.5.3) ================== *Published at 2019/01/14* Several bug fixes and some quality of life enhancements. Breaking Changes message.edit <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.edit> now respects the previous message buttons or link preview being hidden. If you want to toggle them you need to explicitly set them. This is generally the desired behaviour, but may cause some bots to have buttons when they shouldn't. Additions * You can now \"hide_via\" when clicking on results from `client.inline_query <telethon.client.bots.BotMethods.inline_query>` to @bing and @gif. * You can now further configure the logger Telethon uses to suit your needs. Bug fixes Fixes for ReadTheDocs to correctly build the documentation. Fix :tl: UserEmpty not being expected when getting the input variant. The message object returned when sending a message with buttons wouldn't always contain the :tl: ReplyMarkup . Setting email when configuring 2FA wasn't properly supported. utils.resolve_bot_file_id now works again for photos. Enhancements * Chat and channel participants can now be used as peers. * Reworked README and examples at https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/tree/master/telethon_examples Takeout Sessions (v1.5.2) ========================= *Published at 2019/01/05* You can now easily start takeout sessions (also known as data export sessions) through `client.takeout() <telethon.client.account.AccountMethods.takeout>`. Some of the requests will have lower flood limits when done through the takeout session. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ * The new `AdminLogEvent <telethon.tl.custom.adminlogevent.AdminLogEvent>` had a bug that made it unusable. * `client.iter_dialogs() <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.iter_dialogs>` will now locally check for the offset date, since Telegram ignores it. * Answering inline queries with media no works properly. You can now use the library to create inline bots and send stickers through them! object.to_json() (v1.5.1) ========================= *Published at 2019/01/03* The library already had a way to easily convert the objects the API returned into dictionaries through ``object.to_dict()``, but some of the fields are dates or `bytes` which JSON can't serialize directly. For convenience, a new ``object.to_json()`` has been added which will by default format both of those problematic types into something sensible. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ * New `client.iter_admin_log() <telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.iter_admin_log>` method. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ * `client.is_connected() <telethon.client.telegrambaseclient.TelegramBaseClient.is_connected>` would be wrong when the initial connection failed. * Fixed ``UnicodeDecodeError`` when accessing the text of messages with malformed offsets in their entities. * Fixed `client.get_input_entity() <telethon.client.users.UserMethods.get_input_entity>` for integer IDs that the client has not seen before. Enhancements You can now configure the reply markup when using Button <telethon.tl.custom.button.Button> as a bot. More properties for Message <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message> to make accessing media convenient. Downloading to file=bytes will now return a bytes object with the downloaded media.","title":"Animated Stickers (v1.9)"},{"location":"misc/changelog/#polls-with-the-latest-layer-v15","text":"Published at 2018/12/25 +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 91 | +-----------------------+ This version doesn't really bring many new features, but rather focuses on updating the code base to support the latest available Telegram layer, 91. This layer brings polls, and you can create and manage them through Telethon! Breaking Changes * The layer change from 82 to 91 changed a lot of things in the raw API, so be aware that if you rely on raw API calls, you may need to update your code, in particular **if you work with files**. They have a new ``file_reference`` parameter that you must provide. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ * New `client.is_bot() <telethon.client.users.UserMethods.is_bot>` method. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ * Markdown and HTML parsing now behave correctly with leading whitespace. * HTTP connection should now work correctly again. * Using ``caption=None`` would raise an error instead of setting no caption. * ``KeyError`` is now handled properly when forwarding messages. * `button.click() <telethon.tl.custom.messagebutton.MessageButton.click>` now works as expected for :tl:`KeyboardButtonGame`. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ * Some improvements to the search in the full API and generated examples. * Using entities with ``access_hash = 0`` will now work in more cases.

Anyone who wants to update the documentation for known errors, or whether some methods can be used as a bot, user or both, can now be easily edited. Everyone is encouraged to help document this better! Bug fixes * ``TimeoutError`` was not handled during automatic reconnects. * Getting messages by ID using :tl:`InputMessageReplyTo` could fail. * Fixed `message.get_reply_message <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.get_reply_message>` as a bot when a user replied to a different bot. * Accessing some document properties in a `Message <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message>` would fail. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ * Accessing `events.ChatAction <telethon.events.chataction.ChatAction>` properties such as input users may now work in more cases. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ * Error descriptions and information about methods is now loaded from a CSV file instead of being part of several messy JSON files. Bug Fixes (v1.4.2) ================== *Published at 2018/11/24* This version also includes the v1.4.1 hot-fix, which was a single quick fix and didn't really deserve an entry in the changelog. Bug fixes Authorization key wouldn't be saved correctly, requiring re-login. Conversations with custom events failed to be cancelled. Fixed telethon.sync when using other threads. Fix markdown/HTML parser from failing with leading/trailing whitespace. Fix accessing chat_action_event.input_user property. Potentially improved handling unexpected disconnections. Enhancements * Better default behaviour for `client.send_read_acknowledge <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.send_read_acknowledge>`. * Clarified some points in the documentation. * Clearer errors for ``utils.get_peer*``. Connection Overhaul (v1.4) ========================== *Published at 2018/11/03* Yet again, a lot of work has been put into reworking the low level connection classes. This means ``asyncio.open_connection`` is now used correctly and the errors it can produce are handled properly. The separation between packing, encrypting and network is now abstracted away properly, so reasoning about the code is easier, making it more maintainable. As a user, you shouldn't worry about this, other than being aware that quite a few changes were made in the insides of the library and you should report any issues that you encounter with this version if any. Breaking Changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ * The threaded version of the library will no longer be maintained, primarily because it never was properly maintained anyway. If you have old code, stick with old versions of the library, such as ``0.19.1.6``. * Timeouts no longer accept ``timedelta``. Simply use seconds. * The ``callback`` parameter from `telethon.tl.custom.button.Button.inline()` was removed, since it had always been a bad idea. Adding the callback there meant a lot of extra work for every message sent, and only registering it after the first message was sent! Instead, use `telethon.events.callbackquery.CallbackQuery`. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ * New `dialog.delete() <telethon.tl.custom.dialog.Dialog.delete>` method. * New `conversation.cancel() <telethon.tl.custom.conversation.Conversation.cancel>` method. * New ``retry_delay`` delay for the client to be used on auto-reconnection. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ * Fixed `Conversation.wait_event() <telethon.tl.custom.conversation.Conversation.wait_event>`. * Fixed replying with photos/documents on inline results. * `client.is_user_authorized() <telethon.client.users.UserMethods.is_user_authorized>` now works correctly after `client.log_out() <telethon.client.auth.AuthMethods.log_out>`. * `dialog.is_group <telethon.tl.custom.dialog.Dialog>` now works for :tl:`ChatForbidden`. * Not using ``async with`` when needed is now a proper error. * `events.CallbackQuery <telethon.events.callbackquery.CallbackQuery>` with string regex was not working properly. * `client.get_entity('me') <telethon.client.users.UserMethods.get_entity>` now works again. * Empty codes when signing in are no longer valid. * Fixed file cache for in-memory sessions. Enhancements Support next_offset in inline_query.answer() <telethon.events.inlinequery.InlineQuery.Event.answer> . Support <a href=\"tg://user?id=123\"> mentions in HTML parse mode. New auto-casts for :tl: InputDocument and :tl: InputChatPhoto . Conversations are now exclusive per-chat by default. The request that caused a RPC error is now shown in the error message. New full API examples in the generated documentation. Fixed some broken links in the documentation. client.disconnect() <telethon.client.telegrambaseclient.TelegramBaseClient.disconnect> is now synchronous, but you can still await it for consistency or compatibility.","title":"Error Descriptions in CSV files (v1.4.3)"},{"location":"misc/changelog/#event-templates-v13","text":"Published at 2018/09/22 If you have worked with Flask templates, you will love this update, since it gives you the same features but even more conveniently: .. code-block:: python # handlers/welcome.py from telethon import events @events.register(events.NewMessage('(?i)hello')) async def handler(event): client = event.client await event.respond('Hi!') await client.send_message('me', 'Sent hello to someone') This will register <telethon.events.register> the handler callback to handle new message events. Note that you didn't add this to any client yet, and this is the key point: you don't need a client to define handlers! You can add it later: .. code-block:: python # main.py from telethon import TelegramClient import handlers.welcome with TelegramClient(...) as client: # This line adds the handler we defined before for new messages client.add_event_handler(handlers.welcome.handler) client.run_until_disconnected() This should help you to split your big code base into a more modular design. Breaking Changes * ``.sender`` is the ``.chat`` when the message is sent in a broadcast channel. This makes sense, because the sender of the message was the channel itself, but you now must take into consideration that it may be either a :tl:`User` or :tl:`Channel` instead of being `None`. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ * New ``MultiError`` class when invoking many requests at once through ``client([requests])``. * New custom ``func=`` on all events. These will receive the entire event, and a good usage example is ``func=lambda e: e.is_private``. * New ``.web_preview`` field on messages. The ``.photo`` and ``.document`` will also return the media in the web preview if any, for convenience. * Callback queries now have a ``.chat`` in most circumstances. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ * Running code with `python3 -O` would remove critical code from asserts. * Fix some rare ghost disconnections after reconnecting. * Fix strange behavior for `send_message(chat, Message, reply_to=foo) <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.send_message>`. * The ``loop=`` argument was being pretty much ignored. * Fix ``MemorySession`` file caching. * The logic for getting entities from their username is now correct. * Fixes for sending stickers from ``.webp`` files in Windows, again. * Fix disconnection without being logged in. * Retrieving media from messages would fail. * Getting some messages by ID on private chats. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ * `iter_participants <telethon.client.chats.ChatMethods.iter_participants>` will now use its ``search=`` as a symbol set when ``aggressive=True``, so you can do ``client.get_participants(group, aggressive=True, search='\u0430\u0431\u0432\u0433\u0434\u0435\u0451\u0436\u0437\u0438\u0439\u043a\u043b\u043c\u043d\u043e\u043f\u0440\u0441\u0442')``. * The ``StringSession`` supports custom encoding. * Callbacks for `telethon.client.auth.AuthMethods.start` can be ``async``.

Building and resolving events overhaul.","title":"Event Templates (v1.3)"},{"location":"misc/changelog/#conversations-string-sessions-and-more-v12","text":"Published at 2018/08/14 This is a big release! Quite a few things have been added to the library, such as the new Conversation <telethon.tl.custom.conversation.Conversation> . This makes it trivial to get tokens from @BotFather <https://t.me/BotFather> _: .. code-block:: python from telethon.tl import types with client.conversation('BotFather') as conv: conv.send_message('/mybots') message = conv.get_response() message.click(0) message = conv.get_edit() message.click(0) message = conv.get_edit() for _, token in message.get_entities_text(types.MessageEntityCode): print(token) In addition to that, you can now easily load and export session files without creating any on-disk file thanks to the StringSession : .. code-block:: python from telethon.sessions import StringSession string = StringSession.save(client.session) Check out :ref: sessions for more details. For those who aren't able to install cryptg , the support for libssl has been added back. While interfacing libssl is not as fast, the speed when downloading and sending files should really be noticeably faster. While those are the biggest things, there are still more things to be excited about. Additions - The mentioned method to start a new `client.conversation <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.conversation>`. - Implemented global search through `client.iter_messages <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.iter_messages>` with `None` entity. - New `client.inline_query <telethon.client.bots.BotMethods.inline_query>` method to perform inline queries. - Bot-API-style ``file_id`` can now be used to send files and download media. You can also access `telethon.utils.resolve_bot_file_id` and `telethon.utils.pack_bot_file_id` to resolve and create these file IDs yourself. Note that each user has its own ID for each file so you can't use a bot's ``file_id`` with your user, except stickers. - New `telethon.utils.get_peer`, useful when you expect a :tl:`Peer`. Bug fixes UTC timezone for telethon.events.userupdate.UserUpdate . Bug with certain input parameters when iterating messages. RPC errors without parent requests caused a crash, and better logging. incoming = outgoing = True was not working properly. Getting a message's ID was not working. File attributes not being inferred for open() 'ed files. Use MemorySession if sqlite3 is not installed by default. Self-user would not be saved to the session file after signing in. client.catch_up() <telethon.client.updates.UpdateMethods.catch_up> seems to be functional again. Enhancements - Updated documentation. - Invite links will now use cache, so using them as entities is cheaper. - You can reuse message buttons to send new messages with those buttons. - ``.to_dict()`` will now work even on invalid ``TLObject``'s. Better Custom Message (v1.1.1) ============================== *Published at 2018/07/23* The `custom.Message <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message>` class has been rewritten in a cleaner way and overall feels less hacky in the library. This should perform better than the previous way in which it was patched. The release is primarily intended to test this big change, but also fixes **Python 3.5.2 compatibility** which was broken due to a trailing comma. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ - Using ``functools.partial`` on event handlers broke updates if they had uncaught exceptions. - A bug under some session files where the sender would export authorization for the same data center, which is unsupported. - Some logical bugs in the custom message class. Bot Friendly (v1.1) =================== *Published at 2018/07/21* Two new event handlers to ease creating normal bots with the library, namely `events.InlineQuery <telethon.events.inlinequery.InlineQuery>` and `events.CallbackQuery <telethon.events.callbackquery.CallbackQuery>` for handling ``@InlineBot queries`` or reacting to a button click. For this second option, there is an even better way: .. code-block:: python from telethon.tl.custom import Button async def callback(event): await event.edit('Thank you!') bot.send_message(chat, 'Hello!', buttons=Button.inline('Click me', callback)) You can directly pass the callback when creating the button. This is fine for small bots but it will add the callback every time you send a message, so you probably should do this instead once you are done testing: .. code-block:: python markup = bot.build_reply_markup(Button.inline('Click me', callback)) bot.send_message(chat, 'Hello!', buttons=markup) And yes, you can create more complex button layouts with lists: .. code-block:: python from telethon import events global phone = '' @bot.on(events.CallbackQuery) async def handler(event): global phone if event.data == b'<': phone = phone[:-1] else: phone += event.data.decode('utf-8') await event.answer('Phone is now {}'.format(phone)) markup = bot.build_reply_markup([ [Button.inline('1'), Button.inline('2'), Button.inline('3')], [Button.inline('4'), Button.inline('5'), Button.inline('6')], [Button.inline('7'), Button.inline('8'), Button.inline('9')], [Button.inline('+'), Button.inline('0'), Button.inline('<')], ]) bot.send_message(chat, 'Enter a phone', buttons=markup) (Yes, there are better ways to do this). Now for the rest of things: Additions ~~~~~~~~~ - New `custom.Button <telethon.tl.custom.button.Button>` class to help you create inline (or normal) reply keyboards. You must sign in as a bot to use the ``buttons=`` parameters. - New events usable if you sign in as a bot: `events.InlineQuery <telethon.events.inlinequery.InlineQuery>` and `events.CallbackQuery <telethon.events.callbackquery.CallbackQuery>`. - New ``silent`` parameter when sending messages, usable in broadcast channels. - Documentation now has an entire section dedicate to how to use the client's friendly methods at *(removed broken link)*. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ - Empty ``except`` are no longer used which means sending a keyboard interrupt should now work properly. - The ``pts`` of incoming updates could be `None`. - UTC timezone information is properly set for read ``datetime``. - Some infinite recursion bugs in the custom message class. - :tl:`Updates` was being dispatched to raw handlers when it shouldn't. - Using proxies and HTTPS connection mode may now work properly. - Less flood waits when downloading media from different data centers, and the library will now detect them even before sending requests. Enhancements Interactive sign in now supports signing in with a bot token. timedelta is now supported where a date is expected, which means you can e.g. ban someone for timedelta(minutes=5) . Events are only built once and reused many times, which should save quite a few CPU cycles if you have a lot of the same type. You can now click inline buttons directly if you know their data. Internal changes - When downloading media, the right sender is directly used without previously triggering migrate errors. - Code reusing for getting the chat and the sender, which easily enables this feature for new types. New HTTP(S) Connection Mode (v1.0.4) ==================================== *Published at 2018/07/09* This release implements the HTTP connection mode to the library, which means certain proxies that only allow HTTP connections should now work properly. You can use it doing the following, like any other mode: .. code-block:: python from telethon import TelegramClient, sync from telethon.network import ConnectionHttp client = TelegramClient(..., connection=ConnectionHttp) with client: client.send_message('me', 'Hi!') Additions ~~~~~~~~~ - ``add_mark=`` is now back on ``utils.get_input_peer`` and also on `client.get_input_entity() <telethon.client.users.UserMethods.get_input_entity>`. - New `client.get_peer_id <telethon.client.users.UserMethods.get_peer_id>` convenience for ``utils.get_peer_id(await client.get_input_entity(peer))``. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ - If several `TLMessage` in a `MessageContainer` exceeds 1MB, it will no longer be automatically turned into one. This basically means that e.g. uploading 10 file parts at once will work properly again. - Documentation fixes and some missing ``await``. - Revert named argument for `client.forward_messages <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.forward_messages>` Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ - New auto-casts to :tl:`InputNotifyPeer` and ``chat_id``. Internal changes Outgoing TLMessage are now pre-packed so if there's an error when serializing the raw requests, the library will no longer swallow it. This also means re-sending packets doesn't need to re-pack their bytes.","title":"Conversations, String Sessions and More (v1.2)"},{"location":"misc/changelog/#iterate-messages-in-reverse-v103","text":"Published at 2018/07/04 +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 82 | +-----------------------+ Mostly bug fixes, but now there is a new parameter on client.iter_messages <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.iter_messages> to support reversing the order in which messages are returned. Additions - The mentioned ``reverse`` parameter when iterating over messages. - A new ``sequential_updates`` parameter when creating the client for updates to be processed sequentially. This is useful when you need to make sure that all updates are processed in order, such as a script that only forwards incoming messages somewhere else. Bug fixes Count was always None for message.button_count <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.button_count> . Some fixes when disconnecting upon dropping the client. Support for Python 3.4 in the sync version, and fix media download. Some issues with events when accessing the input chat or their media.

This quick update should fix those, namely: Bug fixes - `client.start() <telethon.client.auth.AuthMethods.start>` was completely broken due to a last-time change requiring named arguments everywhere. - Since the rewrite, if your system clock was wrong, the connection would get stuck in an infinite \"bad message\" loop of responses from Telegram. - Accessing the buttons of a custom message wouldn't work in channels, which lead to fix a completely different bug regarding starting bots. - Disconnecting could complain if the magic ``telethon.sync`` was imported. - Successful automatic reconnections now ask Telegram to send updates to us once again as soon as the library is ready to listen for them. Synchronous magic (v1.0) ======================== *Published at 2018/06/27* .. important:: If you come from Telethon pre-1.0 you **really** want to read :ref:`compatibility-and-convenience` to port your scripts to the new version. The library has been around for well over a year. A lot of improvements have been made, a lot of user complaints have been fixed, and a lot of user desires have been implemented. It's time to consider the public API as stable, and remove some of the old methods that were around until now for compatibility reasons. But there's one more surprise! There is a new magic ``telethon.sync`` module to let you use **all** the methods in the :ref:`TelegramClient <telethon-client>` (and the types returned from its functions) in a synchronous way, while using `asyncio` behind the scenes! This means you're now able to do both of the following: .. code-block:: python import asyncio async def main(): await client.send_message('me', 'Hello!') asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main()) # ...can be rewritten as: from telethon import sync client.send_message('me', 'Hello!') Both ways can coexist (you need to ``await`` if the loop is running). You can also use the magic ``sync`` module in your own classes, and call ``sync.syncify(cls)`` to convert all their ``async def`` into magic variants. Breaking Changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - ``message.get_fwd_sender`` is now in `message.forward <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.forward>`. - ``client.idle`` is now `client.run_until_disconnected() <telethon.client.updates.UpdateMethods.run_until_disconnected>` - ``client.add_update_handler`` is now `client.add_event_handler <telethon.client.updates.UpdateMethods.add_event_handler>` - ``client.remove_update_handler`` is now `client.remove_event_handler <telethon.client.updates.UpdateMethods.remove_event_handler>` - ``client.list_update_handlers`` is now `client.list_event_handlers <telethon.client.updates.UpdateMethods.list_event_handlers>` - ``client.get_message_history`` is now `client.get_messages <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.get_messages>` - ``client.send_voice_note`` is now `client.send_file <telethon.client.uploads.UploadMethods.send_file>` with ``is_voice=True``. - ``client.invoke()`` is now ``client(...)``. - ``report_errors`` has been removed since it's currently not used, and ``flood_sleep_threshold`` is now part of the client. - The ``update_workers`` and ``spawn_read_thread`` arguments are gone. Simply remove them from your code when you create the client. - Methods with a lot of arguments can no longer be used without specifying their argument. Instead you need to use named arguments. This improves readability and not needing to learn the order of the arguments, which can also change. Additions client.send_file <telethon.client.uploads.UploadMethods.send_file> now accepts external http:// and https:// URLs. You can use the :ref: TelegramClient <telethon-client> inside of with blocks, which will client.start() <telethon.client.auth.AuthMethods.start> and disconnect() <telethon.client.telegrambaseclient.TelegramBaseClient.disconnect> the client for you: .. code-block:: python from telethon import TelegramClient, sync with TelegramClient(name, api_id, api_hash) as client: client.send_message('me', 'Hello!') Convenience at its maximum! You can even chain the .start() <telethon.client.auth.AuthMethods.start> method since it returns the instance of the client: .. code-block:: python with TelegramClient(name, api_id, api_hash).start(bot_token=token) as bot: bot.send_message(chat, 'Hello!') Bug fixes - There were some ``@property async def`` left, and some ``await property``. - \"User joined\" event was being treated as \"User was invited\". - SQLite's cursor should not be closed properly after usage. - ``await`` the updates task upon disconnection. - Some bug in Python 3.5.2's `asyncio` causing 100% CPU load if you forgot to call `client.disconnect() <telethon.client.telegrambaseclient.TelegramBaseClient.disconnect>`. The method is called for you on object destruction, but you still should disconnect manually or use a ``with`` block. - Some fixes regarding disconnecting on client deletion and properly saving the authorization key. - Passing a class to `message.get_entities_text <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.get_entities_text>` now works properly. - Iterating messages from a specific user in private messages now works. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ - Both `client.start() <telethon.client.auth.AuthMethods.start>` and `client.run_until_disconnected() <telethon.client.updates.UpdateMethods.run_until_disconnected>` can be ran in both a synchronous way (without starting the loop manually) or from an ``async def`` where they need to have an ``await``. Core Rewrite in asyncio (v1.0-rc1) ================================== *Published at 2018/06/24* +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 81 | +-----------------------+ This version is a major overhaul of the library internals. The core has been rewritten, cleaned up and refactored to fix some oddities that have been growing inside the library. This means that the code is easier to understand and reason about, including the code flow such as conditions, exceptions, where to reconnect, how the library should behave, and separating different retry types such as disconnections or call fails, but it also means that **some things will necessarily break** in this version. All requests that touch the network are now methods and need to have their ``await`` (or be ran until their completion). Also, the library finally has the simple logo it deserved: a carefully hand-written ``.svg`` file representing a T following Python's colours. Breaking Changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - If you relied on internals like the ``MtProtoSender`` and the ``TelegramBareClient``, both are gone. They are now `MTProtoSender <telethon.network.mtprotosender.MTProtoSender>` and `TelegramBaseClient <telethon.client.telegrambaseclient.TelegramBaseClient>` and they behave differently. - Underscores have been renamed from filenames. This means ``telethon.errors.rpc_error_list`` won't work, but you should have been using `telethon.errors` all this time instead. - `client.connect <telethon.client.telegrambaseclient.TelegramBaseClient.connect>` no longer returns `True` on success. Instead, you should ``except`` the possible ``ConnectionError`` and act accordingly. This makes it easier to not ignore the error. - You can no longer set ``retries=n`` when calling a request manually. The limit works differently now, and it's done on a per-client basis. - Accessing `.sender <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.sender>`, `.chat <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.chat>` and similar may *not* work in events anymore, since previously they could access the network. The new rule is that properties are not allowed to make API calls. You should use `.get_sender() <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.get_sender>`, `.get_chat() <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.get_chat>` instead while using events. You can safely access properties if you get messages through `client.get_messages() <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.get_messages>` or other methods in the client. - The above point means ``reply_message`` is now `.get_reply_message() <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.get_reply_message>`, and ``fwd_from_entity`` is now `get_fwd_sender() <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.get_fwd_sender>`. Also ``forward`` was gone in the previous version, and you should be using ``fwd_from`` instead. Additions Telegram's Terms Of Service are now accepted when creating a new account. This can possibly help avoid bans. This has no effect for accounts that were created before. The method reference <https://tl.telethon.dev/> _ now shows which methods can be used if you sign in with a bot_token . There's a new client.disconnected <telethon.client.telegrambaseclient.TelegramBaseClient.disconnected> future which you can wait on. When a disconnection occurs, you will now, instead letting it happen in the background. More configurable retries parameters, such as auto-reconnection, retries when connecting, and retries when sending a request. You can filter events.NewMessage <telethon.events.newmessage.NewMessage> by sender ID, and also whether they are forwards or not. New ignore_migrated parameter for client.iter_dialogs <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.iter_dialogs> . Bug fixes - Several fixes to `telethon.events.newmessage.NewMessage`. - Removed named ``length`` argument in ``to_bytes`` for PyPy. - Raw events failed due to not having ``._set_client``. - `message.get_entities_text <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.get_entities_text>` properly supports filtering, even if there are no message entities. - `message.click <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.click>` works better. - The server started sending :tl:`DraftMessageEmpty` which the library didn't handle correctly when getting dialogs. - The \"correct\" chat is now always returned from returned messages. - ``to_id`` was not validated when retrieving messages by their IDs. - ``'__'`` is no longer considered valid in usernames. - The ``fd`` is removed from the reader upon closing the socket. This should be noticeable in Windows. - :tl:`MessageEmpty` is now handled when searching messages. - Fixed a rare infinite loop bug in `client.iter_dialogs <telethon.client.dialogs.DialogMethods.iter_dialogs>` for some people. - Fixed ``TypeError`` when there is no `.sender <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.sender>`. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ - You can now delete over 100 messages at once with `client.delete_messages <telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.delete_messages>`. - Signing in now accounts for ``AuthRestartError`` itself, and also handles ``PasswordHashInvalidError``. - ``__all__`` is now defined, so ``from telethon import *`` imports sane defaults (client, events and utils). This is however discouraged and should be used only in quick scripts. - ``pathlib.Path`` is now supported for downloading and uploading media. - Messages you send to yourself are now considered outgoing, unless they are forwarded. - The documentation has been updated with a brand new `asyncio` crash course to encourage you use it. You can still use the threaded version if you want though. - ``.name`` property is now properly supported when sending and downloading files. - Custom ``parse_mode``, which can now be set per-client, support :tl:`MessageEntityMentionName` so you can return those now. - The session file is saved less often, which could result in a noticeable speed-up when working with a lot of incoming updates. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - The flow for sending a request is as follows: the ``TelegramClient`` creates a ``MTProtoSender`` with a ``Connection``, and the sender starts send and receive loops. Sending a request means enqueueing it in the sender, which will eventually pack and encrypt it with its ``ConnectionState`` instead of using the entire ``Session`` instance. When the data is packed, it will be sent over the ``Connection`` and ultimately over the ``TcpClient``. - Reconnection occurs at the ``MTProtoSender`` level, and receiving responses follows a similar process, but now ``asyncio.Future`` is used for the results which are no longer part of all ``TLObject``, instead are part of the ``TLMessage`` which simplifies things. - Objects can no longer be ``content_related`` and instead subclass ``TLRequest``, making the separation of concerns easier. - The ``TelegramClient`` has been split into several mixin classes to avoid having a 3,000-lines-long file with all the methods. - More special cases in the ``MTProtoSender`` have been cleaned up, and also some attributes from the ``Session`` which didn't really belong there since they weren't being saved. - The ``telethon_generator/`` can now convert ``.tl`` files into ``.json``, mostly as a proof of concept, but it might be useful for other people. Custom Message class (v0.19.1) ============================== *Published at 2018/06/03* +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 80 | +-----------------------+ This update brings a new `telethon.tl.custom.message.Message` object! All the methods in the `telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient` that used to return a :tl:`Message` will now return this object instead, which means you can do things like the following: .. code-block:: python msg = client.send_message(chat, 'Hello!') msg.edit('Hello there!') msg.reply('Good day!') print(msg.sender) Refer to its documentation to see all you can do, again, click `telethon.tl.custom.message.Message` to go to its page. Breaking Changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - The `telethon.network.connection.common.Connection` class is now an ABC, and the old ``ConnectionMode`` is now gone. Use a specific connection (like `telethon.network.connection.tcpabridged.ConnectionTcpAbridged`) instead. Additions You can get messages by their ID with telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.get_messages 's ids parameter: .. code-block:: python message = client.get_messages(chats, ids=123) # Single message message_list = client.get_messages(chats, ids=[777, 778]) # Multiple More convenience properties for telethon.tl.custom.dialog.Dialog . New default telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.parse_mode . You can edit the media of messages that already have some media. New dark theme in the online tl reference, check it out at https://tl.telethon.dev/ . Bug fixes - Some IDs start with ``1000`` and these would be wrongly treated as channels. - Some short usernames like ``@vote`` were being ignored. - `telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.iter_messages`'s ``from_user`` was failing if no filter had been set. - `telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.iter_messages`'s ``min_id/max_id`` was being ignored by Telegram. This is now worked around. - `telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.catch_up` would fail with empty states. - `telethon.events.newmessage.NewMessage` supports ``incoming=False`` to indicate ``outgoing=True``. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ - You can now send multiple requests at once while preserving the order: .. code-block:: python from telethon.tl.functions.messages import SendMessageRequest client([SendMessageRequest(chat, 'Hello 1!'), SendMessageRequest(chat, 'Hello 2!')], ordered=True) Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - ``without rowid`` is not used in SQLite anymore. - Unboxed serialization would fail. - Different default limit for ``iter_messages`` and ``get_messages``. - Some clean-up in the ``telethon_generator/`` package. Catching up on Updates (v0.19) ============================== *Published at 2018/05/07* +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 76 | +-----------------------+ This update prepares the library for catching up with updates with the new `telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.catch_up` method. This feature needs more testing, but for now it will let you \"catch up\" on some old updates that occurred while the library was offline, and brings some new features and bug fixes. Additions Add search , filter and from_user parameters to telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.iter_messages . telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.download_file now supports a None path to return the file in memory and return its bytes . Events now have a .original_update field. Bug fixes - Fixed a race condition when receiving items from the network. - A disconnection is made when \"retries reached 0\". This hasn't been tested but it might fix the bug. - ``reply_to`` would not override :tl:`Message` object's reply value. - Add missing caption when sending :tl:`Message` with media. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ - Retry automatically on ``RpcCallFailError``. This error happened a lot when iterating over many messages, and retrying often fixes it. - Faster `telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.iter_messages` by sleeping only as much as needed. - `telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.edit_message` now supports omitting the entity if you pass a :tl:`Message`. - `telethon.events.raw.Raw` can now be filtered by type. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - The library now distinguishes between MTProto and API schemas. - :tl:`State` is now persisted to the session file. - Connection won't retry forever. - Fixed some errors and cleaned up the generation of code. - Fixed typos and enhanced some documentation in general. - Add auto-cast for :tl:`InputMessage` and :tl:`InputLocation`. Pickle-able objects (v0.18.3) ============================= *Published at 2018/04/15* Now you can use Python's ``pickle`` module to serialize ``RPCError`` and any other ``TLObject`` thanks to **@vegeta1k95**! A fix that was fairly simple, but still might be useful for many people. As a side note, the documentation at https://tl.telethon.dev now lists known ``RPCError`` for all requests, so you know what to expect. This required a major rewrite, but it was well worth it! Breaking changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - `telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.forward_messages` now returns a single item instead of a list if the input was also a single item. Additions New telethon.events.messageread.MessageRead event, to find out when and who read which messages as soon as it happens. Now you can access .chat_id on all events and .sender_id on some. Bug fixes - Possibly fix some bug regarding lost ``GzipPacked`` requests. - The library now uses the \"real\" layer 75, hopefully. - Fixed ``.entities`` name collision on updates by making it private. - ``AUTH_KEY_DUPLICATED`` is handled automatically on connection. - Markdown parser's offset uses ``match.start()`` to allow custom regex. - Some filter types (as a type) were not supported by `telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.iter_participants`. - `telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.remove_event_handler` works. - `telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.start` works on all terminals. - :tl:`InputPeerSelf` case was missing from `telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.get_input_entity`. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ - The ``parse_mode`` for messages now accepts a callable. - `telethon.telegram_client.TelegramClient.download_media` accepts web previews. - `telethon.tl.custom.dialog.Dialog` instances can now be casted into :tl:`InputPeer`. - Better logging when reading packages \"breaks\". - Better and more powerful ``setup.py gen`` command. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - The library won't call ``.get_dialogs()`` on entity not found. Instead, it will ``raise ValueError()`` so you can properly ``except`` it. - Several new examples and updated documentation. - ``py:obj`` is the default Sphinx's role which simplifies ``.rst`` files. - ``setup.py`` now makes use of ``python_requires``. - Events now live in separate files. - Other minor changes. Several bug fixes (v0.18.2) =========================== *Published at 2018/03/27* Just a few bug fixes before they become too many. Additions Getting an entity by its positive ID should be enough, regardless of their type (whether it's an User , a Chat or a Channel ). Although wrapping them inside a Peer is still recommended, it's not necessary. New client.edit_2fa function to change your Two Factor Authentication settings. .stringify() and string representation for custom Dialog/Draft . Bug fixes - Some bug regarding ``.get_input_peer``. - ``events.ChatAction`` wasn't picking up all the pins. - ``force_document=True`` was being ignored for albums. - Now you're able to send ``Photo`` and ``Document`` as files. - Wrong access to a member on chat forbidden error for ``.get_participants``. An empty list is returned instead. - ``me/self`` check for ``.get[_input]_entity`` has been moved up so if someone has \"me\" or \"self\" as their name they won't be retrieved. Iterator methods (v0.18.1) ========================== *Published at 2018/03/17* All the ``.get_`` methods in the ``TelegramClient`` now have a ``.iter_`` counterpart, so you can do operations while retrieving items from them. For instance, you can ``client.iter_dialogs()`` and ``break`` once you find what you're looking for instead fetching them all at once. Another big thing, you can get entities by just their positive ID. This may cause some collisions (although it's very unlikely), and you can (should) still be explicit about the type you want. However, it's a lot more convenient and less confusing. Breaking changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - The library only offers the default ``SQLiteSession`` again. See :ref:`sessions` for more on how to use a different storage from now on. Additions Events now override __str__ and implement .stringify() , just like every other TLObject does. events.ChatAction now has :meth: respond , :meth: reply and :meth: delete for the message that triggered it. :meth: client.iter_participants (and its :meth: client.get_participants counterpart) now expose the filter argument, and the returned users also expose the .participant they are. You can now use :meth: client.remove_event_handler and :meth: client.list_event_handlers similar how you could with normal updates. New properties on events.NewMessage , like .video_note and .gif to access only specific types of documents. The Draft class now exposes .text and .raw_text , as well as a new :meth: Draft.send to send it. Bug fixes - ``MessageEdited`` was ignoring ``NewMessage`` constructor arguments. - Fixes for ``Event.delete_messages`` which wouldn't handle ``MessageService``. - Bot API style IDs not working on :meth:`client.get_input_entity`. - :meth:`client.download_media` didn't support ``PhotoSize``. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ - Less RPC are made when accessing the ``.sender`` and ``.chat`` of some events (mostly those that occur in a channel). - You can send albums larger than 10 items (they will be sliced for you), as well as mixing normal files with photos. - ``TLObject`` now have Python type hints. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - Several documentation corrections. - :meth:`client.get_dialogs` is only called once again when an entity is not found to avoid flood waits. Sessions overhaul (v0.18) ========================= *Published at 2018/03/04* +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 75 | +-----------------------+ The ``Session``'s have been revisited thanks to the work of **@tulir** and they now use an `ABC <https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html>`__ so you can easily implement your own! The default will still be a ``SQLiteSession``, but you might want to use the new ``AlchemySessionContainer`` if you need. Refer to the section of the documentation on :ref:`sessions` for more. Breaking changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - ``events.MessageChanged`` doesn't exist anymore. Use the new ``events.MessageEdited`` and ``events.MessageDeleted`` instead. Additions The mentioned addition of new session types. You can omit the event type on client.add_event_handler to use Raw . You can raise StopPropagation of events if you added several of them. .get_participants() can now get up to 90,000 members from groups with 100,000 if when aggressive=True , \"bypassing\" Telegram's limit. You now can access NewMessage.Event.pattern_match . Multiple captions are now supported when sending albums. client.send_message() has an optional file= parameter, so you can do events.reply(file='/path/to/photo.jpg') and similar. Added .input_ versions to events.ChatAction . You can now access the public .client property on events . New client.forward_messages , with its own wrapper on events , called event.forward_to(...) . Bug fixes - Silly bug regarding ``client.get_me(input_peer=True)``. - ``client.send_voice_note()`` was missing some parameters. - ``client.send_file()`` plays better with streams now. - Incoming messages from bots weren't working with whitelists. - Markdown's URL regex was not accepting newlines. - Better attempt at joining background update threads. - Use the right peer type when a marked integer ID is provided. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - Resolving ``events.Raw`` is now a no-op. - Logging calls in the ``TcpClient`` to spot errors. - ``events`` resolution is postponed until you are successfully connected, so you can attach them before starting the client. - When an entity is not found, it is searched in *all* dialogs. This might not always be desirable but it's more comfortable for legitimate uses. - Some non-persisting properties from the ``Session`` have been moved out. Further easing library usage (v0.17.4) ====================================== *Published at 2018/02/24* Some new things and patches that already deserved their own release. Additions New pattern argument to NewMessage to easily filter messages. New .get_participants() convenience method to get members from chats. .send_message() now accepts a Message as the message parameter. You can now .get_entity() through exact name match instead username. Raise ProxyConnectionError instead looping forever so you can except it on your own code and behave accordingly. Bug fixes - ``.parse_username`` would fail with ``www.`` or a trailing slash. - ``events.MessageChanged`` would fail with ``UpdateDeleteMessages``. - You can now send ``b'byte strings'`` directly as files again. - ``.send_file()`` was not respecting the original captions when passing another message (or media) as the file. - Downloading media from a different data center would always log a warning for the first time. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - Use ``req_pq_multi`` instead ``req_pq`` when generating ``auth_key``. - You can use ``.get_me(input_peer=True)`` if all you need is your self ID. - New addition to the interactive client example to show peer information. - Avoid special casing ``InputPeerSelf`` on some ``NewMessage`` events, so you can always safely rely on ``.sender`` to get the right ID. New small convenience functions (v0.17.3) ========================================= *Published at 2018/02/18* More bug fixes and a few others addition to make events easier to use. Additions Use hachoir to extract video and audio metadata before upload. New .add_event_handler , .add_update_handler now deprecated. Bug fixes - ``bot_token`` wouldn't work on ``.start()``, and changes to ``password`` (now it will ask you for it if you don't provide it, as docstring hinted). - ``.edit_message()`` was ignoring the formatting (e.g. markdown). - Added missing case to the ``NewMessage`` event for normal groups. - Accessing the ``.text`` of the ``NewMessage`` event was failing due to a bug with the markdown unparser. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - ``libssl`` is no longer an optional dependency. Use ``cryptg`` instead, which you can find on https://pypi.org/project/cryptg/. New small convenience functions (v0.17.2) ========================================= *Published at 2018/02/15* Primarily bug fixing and a few welcomed additions. Additions New convenience .edit_message() method on the TelegramClient . New .edit() and .delete() shorthands on the NewMessage event. Default to markdown parsing when sending and editing messages. Support for inline mentions when sending and editing messages. They work like inline urls (e.g. [text](@username) ) and also support the Bot-API style (see here <https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#formatting-options> __). Bug fixes - Periodically send ``GetStateRequest`` automatically to keep the server sending updates even if you're not invoking any request yourself. - HTML parsing was failing due to not handling surrogates properly. - ``.sign_up`` was not accepting ``int`` codes. - Whitelisting more than one chat on ``events`` wasn't working. - Video files are sent as a video by default unless ``force_document``. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - More ``logging`` calls to help spot some bugs in the future. - Some more logic to retrieve input entities on events. - Clarified a few parts of the documentation. Updates as Events (v0.17.1) =========================== *Published at 2018/02/09* Of course there was more work to be done regarding updates, and it's here! The library comes with a new ``events`` module (which you will often import as ``from telethon import TelegramClient, events``). This are pretty much all the additions that come with this version change, but they are a nice addition. Refer to *(removed broken link)* to get started with events. Trust the Server with Updates (v0.17) ===================================== *Published at 2018/02/03* The library trusts the server with updates again. The library will *not* check for duplicates anymore, and when the server kicks us, it will run ``GetStateRequest`` so the server starts sending updates again (something it wouldn't do unless you invoked something, it seems). But this update also brings a few more changes! Additions TLObject 's override __eq__ and __ne__ , so you can compare them. Added some missing cases on .get_input_entity() and peer functions. obj.to_dict() now has a '_' key with the type used. .start() can also sign up now. More parameters for .get_message_history() . Updated list of RPC errors. HTML parsing thanks to @tulir ! It can be used similar to markdown: client.send_message(..., parse_mode='html') . Enhancements - ``client.send_file()`` now accepts ``Message``'s and ``MessageMedia``'s as the ``file`` parameter. - Some documentation updates and fixed to clarify certain things. - New exact match feature on https://tl.telethon.dev. - Return as early as possible from ``.get_input_entity()`` and similar, to avoid penalizing you for doing this right. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ - ``.download_media()`` wouldn't accept a ``Document`` as parameter. - The SQLite is now closed properly on disconnection. - IPv6 addresses shouldn't use square braces. - Fix regarding ``.log_out()``. - The time offset wasn't being used (so having wrong system time would cause the library not to work at all). New ``.resolve()`` method (v0.16.2) =================================== *Published at 2018/01/19* The ``TLObject``'s (instances returned by the API and ``Request``'s) have now acquired a new ``.resolve()`` method. While this should be used by the library alone (when invoking a request), it means that you can now use ``Peer`` types or even usernames where a ``InputPeer`` is required. The object now has access to the ``client``, so that it can fetch the right type if needed, or access the session database. Furthermore, you can reuse requests that need \"autocast\" (e.g. you put :tl:`User` but ``InputPeer`` was needed), since ``.resolve()`` is called when invoking. Before, it was only done on object construction. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ - Album support. Just pass a list, tuple or any iterable to ``.send_file()``. Enhancements .start() asks for your phone only if required. Better file cache. All files under 10MB, once uploaded, should never be needed to be re-uploaded again, as the sent media is cached to the session. Bug fixes - ``setup.py`` now calls ``gen_tl`` when installing the library if needed. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - The mentioned ``.resolve()`` to perform \"autocast\", more powerful. - Upload and download methods are no longer part of ``TelegramBareClient``. - Reuse ``.on_response()``, ``.__str__`` and ``.stringify()``. Only override ``.on_response()`` if necessary (small amount of cases). - Reduced \"autocast\" overhead as much as possible. You shouldn't be penalized if you've provided the right type. MtProto 2.0 (v0.16.1) ===================== *Published at 2018/01/11* +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 74 | +-----------------------+ The library is now using MtProto 2.0! This shouldn't really affect you as an end user, but at least it means the library will be ready by the time MtProto 1.0 is deprecated. Additions New .start() method, to make the library avoid boilerplate code. .send_file accepts a new optional thumbnail parameter, and returns the Message with the sent file. Bug fixes - The library uses again only a single connection. Less updates are be dropped now, and the performance is even better than using temporary connections. - ``without rowid`` will only be used on the ``*.session`` if supported. - Phone code hash is associated with phone, so you can change your mind when calling ``.sign_in()``. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - File cache now relies on the hash of the file uploaded instead its path, and is now persistent in the ``*.session`` file. Report any bugs on this! - Clearer error when invoking without being connected. - Markdown parser doesn't work on bytes anymore (which makes it cleaner). Sessions as sqlite databases (v0.16) ==================================== *Published at 2017/12/28* In the beginning, session files used to be pickle. This proved to be bad as soon as one wanted to add more fields. For this reason, they were migrated to use JSON instead. But this proved to be bad as soon as one wanted to save things like entities (usernames, their ID and hash), so now it properly uses `sqlite3 <https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html>`__, which has been well tested, to save the session files! Calling ``.get_input_entity`` using a ``username`` no longer will need to fetch it first, so it's really 0 calls again. Calling ``.get_entity`` will always fetch the most up to date version. Furthermore, nearly everything has been documented, thus preparing the library for `Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org/>`__ (although there are a few things missing I'd like to polish first), and the `logging <https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html>`__ are now better placed. Breaking changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - ``.get_dialogs()`` now returns a **single list** instead a tuple consisting of a **custom class** that should make everything easier to work with. - ``.get_message_history()`` also returns a **single list** instead a tuple, with the ``Message`` instances modified to make them more convenient. Both lists have a ``.total`` attribute so you can still know how many dialogs/messages are in total. Additions The mentioned use of sqlite3 for the session file. .get_entity() now supports lists too, and it will make as little API calls as possible if you feed it InputPeer types. Usernames will always be resolved, since they may have changed. .set_proxy() method, to avoid having to create a new TelegramClient . More date types supported to represent a date parameter. Bug fixes - Empty strings weren't working when they were a flag parameter (e.g., setting no last name). - Fix invalid assertion regarding flag parameters as well. - Avoid joining the background thread on disconnect, as it would be `None` due to a race condition. - Correctly handle `None` dates when downloading media. - ``.download_profile_photo`` was failing for some channels. - ``.download_media`` wasn't handling ``Photo``. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - ``date`` was being serialized as local date, but that was wrong. - ``date`` was being represented as a ``float`` instead of an ``int``. - ``.tl`` parser wasn't stripping inline comments. - Removed some redundant checks on ``update_state.py``. - Use a `synchronized queue <https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html>`__ instead a hand crafted version. - Use signed integers consistently (e.g. ``salt``). - Always read the corresponding ``TLObject`` from API responses, except for some special cases still. - A few more ``except`` low level to correctly wrap errors. - More accurate exception types. - ``invokeWithLayer(initConnection(X))`` now wraps every first request after ``.connect()``. As always, report if you have issues with some of the changes! IPv6 support (v0.15.5) ====================== *Published at 2017/11/16* +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 73 | +-----------------------+ It's here, it has come! The library now **supports IPv6**! Just pass ``use_ipv6=True`` when creating a ``TelegramClient``. Note that I could *not* test this feature because my machine doesn't have IPv6 setup. If you know IPv6 works in your machine but the library doesn't, please refer to `#425 <https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/issues/425>`_. Additions IPv6 support. New method to extract the text surrounded by MessageEntity \\ 's, in the extensions.markdown module. Enhancements - Markdown parsing is Done Right. - Reconnection on failed invoke. Should avoid \"number of retries reached 0\" (#270). - Some missing autocast to ``Input*`` types. - The library uses the ``NullHandler`` for ``logging`` as it should have always done. - ``TcpClient.is_connected()`` is now more reliable. .. bug-fixes-1: Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ - Getting an entity using their phone wasn't actually working. - Full entities aren't saved unless they have an ``access_hash``, to avoid some `None` errors. - ``.get_message_history`` was failing when retrieving items that had messages forwarded from a channel. General enhancements (v0.15.4) ============================== *Published at 2017/11/04* +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 72 | +-----------------------+ This update brings a few general enhancements that are enough to deserve a new release, with a new feature: beta **markdown-like parsing** for ``.send_message()``! .. additions-1: Additions ~~~~~~~~~ - ``.send_message()`` supports ``parse_mode='md'`` for **Markdown**! It works in a similar fashion to the official clients (defaults to double underscore/asterisk, like ``**this**``). Please report any issues with emojies or enhancements for the parser! - New ``.idle()`` method so your main thread can do useful job (listen for updates). - Add missing ``.to_dict()``, ``__str__`` and ``.stringify()`` for ``TLMessage`` and ``MessageContainer``. .. bug-fixes-2: Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ - The list of known peers could end \"corrupted\" and have users with ``access_hash=None``, resulting in ``struct`` error for it not being an integer. You shouldn't encounter this issue anymore. - The warning for \"added update handler but no workers set\" wasn't actually working. - ``.get_input_peer`` was ignoring a case for ``InputPeerSelf``. - There used to be an exception when logging exceptions (whoops) on update handlers. - \"Downloading contacts\" would produce strange output if they had semicolons (``;``) in their name. - Fix some cyclic imports and installing dependencies from the ``git`` repository. - Code generation was using f-strings, which are only supported on Python \u22653.6. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - The ``auth_key`` generation has been moved from ``.connect()`` to ``.invoke()``. There were some issues were ``.connect()`` failed and the ``auth_key`` was `None` so this will ensure to have a valid ``auth_key`` when needed, even if ``BrokenAuthKeyError`` is raised. - Support for higher limits on ``.get_history()`` and ``.get_dialogs()``. - Much faster integer factorization when generating the required ``auth_key``. Thanks @delivrance for making me notice this, and for the pull request. Bug fixes with updates (v0.15.3) ================================ *Published at 2017/10/20* Hopefully a very ungrateful bug has been removed. When you used to invoke some request through update handlers, it could potentially enter an infinite loop. This has been mitigated and it's now safe to invoke things again! A lot of updates were being dropped (all those gzipped), and this has been fixed too. More bug fixes include a `correct parsing <https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/commit/ee01724cdb7027c1e38625d31446ba1ea7bade92>`__ of certain TLObjects thanks to @stek29, and `some <https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/commit/ed77ba6f8ff115ac624f02f691c9991e5b37be60>`__ `wrong calls <https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/commit/16cf94c9add5e94d70c4eee2ac142d8e76af48b9>`__ that would cause the library to crash thanks to @andr-04, and the ``ReadThread`` not re-starting if you were already authorized. Internally, the ``.to_bytes()`` function has been replaced with ``__bytes__`` so now you can do ``bytes(tlobject)``. Bug fixes and new small features (v0.15.2) ========================================== *Published at 2017/10/14* This release primarly focuses on a few bug fixes and enhancements. Although more stuff may have broken along the way. Enhancements You will be warned if you call .add_update_handler with no update_workers . New customizable threshold value on the session to determine when to automatically sleep on flood waits. See client.session.flood_sleep_threshold . New .get_drafts() method with a custom Draft class by @JosXa . Join all threads when calling .disconnect() , to assert no dangling thread is left alive. Larger chunk when downloading files should result in faster downloads. You can use a callable key for the EntityDatabase , so it can be any filter you need. .. bug-fixes-3: Bug fixes - ``.get_input_entity`` was failing for IDs and other cases, also making more requests than it should. - Use ``basename`` instead ``abspath`` when sending a file. You can now also override the attributes. - ``EntityDatabase.__delitem__`` wasn't working. - ``.send_message()`` was failing with channels. - ``.get_dialogs(limit=None)`` should now return all the dialogs correctly. - Temporary fix for abusive duplicated updates. .. enhancements-1: .. internal-changes-1: Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - MsgsAck is now sent in a container rather than its own request. - ``.get_input_photo`` is now used in the generated code. - ``.process_entities`` was being called from more places than only ``__call__``. - ``MtProtoSender`` now relies more on the generated code to read responses. Custom Entity Database (v0.15.1) ================================ *Published at 2017/10/05* The main feature of this release is that Telethon now has a custom database for all the entities you encounter, instead depending on ``@lru_cache`` on the ``.get_entity()`` method. The ``EntityDatabase`` will, by default, **cache** all the users, chats and channels you find in memory for as long as the program is running. The session will, by default, save all key-value pairs of the entity identifiers and their hashes (since Telegram may send an ID that it thinks you already know about, we need to save this information). You can **prevent** the ``EntityDatabase`` from saving users by setting ``client.session.entities.enabled = False``, and prevent the ``Session`` from saving input entities at all by setting ``client.session.save_entities = False``. You can also clear the cache for a certain user through ``client.session.entities.clear_cache(entity=None)``, which will clear all if no entity is given. Additions New method to .delete_messages() . New ChannelPrivateError class. Enhancements - ``.sign_in`` accepts phones as integers. - Changing the IP to which you connect to is as simple as ``client.session.server_address = 'ip'``, since now the server address is always queried from the session. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ - ``.get_dialogs()`` doesn't fail on Windows anymore, and returns the right amount of dialogs. - ``GeneralProxyError`` should be passed to the main thread again, so that you can handle it. Updates Overhaul Update (v0.15) =============================== *Published at 2017/10/01* After hundreds of lines changed on a major refactor, *it's finally here*. It's the **Updates Overhaul Update**; let's get right into it! Breaking changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - ``.create_new_connection()`` is gone for good. No need to deal with this manually since new connections are now handled on demand by the library itself. Enhancements You can invoke requests from update handlers . And any other thread . A new temporary will be made, so that you can be sending even several requests at the same time! Several worker threads for your updates! By default, None will spawn. I recommend you to work with update_workers=4 to get started, these will be polling constantly for updates. You can also change the number of workers at any given time. The library can now run in a single thread again, if you don't need to spawn any at all. Simply set spawn_read_thread=False when creating the TelegramClient ! You can specify limit=None on .get_dialogs() to get all of them[1]. Updates are expanded , so you don't need to check if the update has .updates or an inner .update anymore. All InputPeer entities are saved in the session file, but you can disable this by setting save_entities=False . New .get_input_entity method, which makes use of the above feature. You should use this when a request needs a InputPeer , rather than the whole entity (although both work). Assert that either all or None dependent-flag parameters are set before sending the request. Phone numbers can have dashes, spaces, or parenthesis. They'll be removed before making the request. You can override the phone and its hash on .sign_in() , if you're creating a new TelegramClient on two different places. Bug fixes - ``.log_out()`` was consuming all retries. It should work just fine now. - The session would fail to load if the ``auth_key`` had been removed manually. - ``Updates.check_error`` was popping wrong side, although it's been completely removed. - ``ServerError``\\ 's will be **ignored**, and the request will immediately be retried. - Cross-thread safety when saving the session file. - Some things changed on a matter of when to reconnect, so please report any bugs! .. internal-changes-2: Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - ``TelegramClient`` is now only an abstraction over the ``TelegramBareClient``, which can only do basic things, such as invoking requests, working with files, etc. If you don't need any of the abstractions the ``TelegramClient``, you can now use the ``TelegramBareClient`` in a much more comfortable way. - ``MtProtoSender`` is not thread-safe, but it doesn't need to be since a new connection will be spawned when needed. - New connections used to be cached and then reused. Now only their sessions are saved, as temporary connections are spawned only when needed. - Added more RPC errors to the list. **[1]:** Broken due to a condition which should had been the opposite (sigh), fixed 4 commits ahead on https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/commit/62ea77cbeac7c42bfac85aa8766a1b5b35e3a76c. -------------- **That's pretty much it**, although there's more work to be done to make the overall experience of working with updates *even better*. Stay tuned! Serialization bug fixes (v0.14.2) ================================= *Published at 2017/09/29* Bug fixes Important , related to the serialization. Every object or request that had to serialize a True/False type was always being serialized as false ! Another bug that didn't allow you to leave as None flag parameters that needed a list has been fixed. Internal changes - Other internal changes include a somewhat more readable ``.to_bytes()`` function and pre-computing the flag instead using bit shifting. The ``TLObject.constructor_id`` has been renamed to ``TLObject.CONSTRUCTOR_ID``, and ``.subclass_of_id`` is also uppercase now. Farewell, BinaryWriter (v0.14.1) ================================ *Published at 2017/09/28* Version ``v0.14`` had started working on the new ``.to_bytes()`` method to dump the ``BinaryWriter`` and its usage on the ``.on_send()`` when serializing TLObjects, and this release finally removes it. The speed up when serializing things to bytes should now be over twice as fast wherever it's needed. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ - This version is again compatible with Python 3.x versions **below 3.5** (there was a method call that was Python 3.5 and above). Internal changes Using proper classes (including the generated code) for generating authorization keys and to write out TLMessage \\ 's.","title":"Bug Fixes (v1.0.1)"},{"location":"misc/changelog/#several-requests-at-once-and-upload-compression-v014","text":"Published at 2017/09/27 New major release, since I've decided that these two features are big enough: Additions - Requests larger than 512 bytes will be **compressed through gzip**, and if the result is smaller, this will be uploaded instead. - You can now send **multiple requests at once**, they're simply ``*var_args`` on the ``.invoke()``. Note that the server doesn't guarantee the order in which they'll be executed! Internally, another important change. The ``.on_send`` function on the ``TLObjects`` is **gone**, and now there's a new ``.to_bytes()``. From my tests, this has always been over twice as fast serializing objects, although more replacements need to be done, so please report any issues. Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ - Implemented ``.get_input_media`` helper methods. Now you can even use another message as input media! Bug fixes Downloading media from CDNs wasn't working (wrong access to a parameter). Correct type hinting. Added a tiny sleep when trying to perform automatic reconnection. Error reporting is done in the background, and has a shorter timeout. setup.py used to fail with wrongly generated code.","title":"Several requests at once and upload compression (v0.14)"},{"location":"misc/changelog/#quick-fix-up-v0136","text":"Published at 2017/09/23 Before getting any further, here's a quick fix-up with things that should have been on v0.13.5 but were missed. Specifically, the timeout when receiving a request will now work properly.

This release should really improve the experience with the background thread that the library starts to read things from the network as soon as it can, but I can't spot every use case, so please report any bug (and as always, minimal reproducible use cases will help a lot). .. bug-fixes-4: Bug fixes - ``setup.py`` was failing on Python < 3.5 due to some imports. - Duplicated updates should now be ignored. - ``.send_message`` would crash in some cases, due to having a typo using the wrong object. - ``\"socket is None\"`` when calling ``.connect()`` should not happen anymore. - ``BrokenPipeError`` was still being raised due to an incorrect order on the ``try/except`` block. .. enhancements-2: Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ - **Type hinting** for all the generated ``Request``\\ 's and ``TLObjects``! IDEs like PyCharm will benefit from this. - ``ProxyConnectionError`` should properly be passed to the main thread for you to handle. - The background thread will only be started after you're authorized on Telegram (i.e. logged in), and several other attempts at polishing the experience with this thread. - The ``Connection`` instance is only created once now, and reused later. - Calling ``.connect()`` should have a better behavior now (like actually *trying* to connect even if we seemingly were connected already). - ``.reconnect()`` behavior has been changed to also be more consistent by making the assumption that we'll only reconnect if the server has disconnected us, and is now private. .. other-changes-1: Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - ``TLObject.__repr__`` doesn't show the original TL definition anymore, it was a lot of clutter. If you have any complaints open an issue and we can discuss it. - Internally, the ``'+'`` from the phone number is now stripped, since it shouldn't be included. - Spotted a new place where ``BrokenAuthKeyError`` would be raised, and it now is raised there. More bug fixes and enhancements (v0.13.4) ========================================= *Published at 2017/09/18* .. new-stuff-1: Additions TelegramClient now exposes a .is_connected() method. Initial authorization on a new data center will retry up to 5 times by default. Errors that couldn't be handled on the background thread will be raised on the next call to .invoke() or updates.poll() . .. bugs-fixed-1: Bug fixes - Now you should be able to sign in even if you have ``process_updates=True`` and no previous session. - Some errors and methods are documented a bit clearer. - ``.send_message()`` could randomly fail, as the returned type was not expected. - ``TimeoutError`` is now ignored, since the request will be retried up to 5 times by default. - \"-404\" errors (``BrokenAuthKeyError``\\ 's) are now detected when first connecting to a new data center. - ``BufferError`` is handled more gracefully, in the same way as ``InvalidCheckSumError``\\ 's. - Attempt at fixing some \"NoneType has no attribute\u2026\" errors (with the ``.sender``). Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - Calling ``GetConfigRequest`` is now made less often. - The ``initial_query`` parameter from ``.connect()`` is gone, as it's not needed anymore. - Renamed ``all_tlobjects.layer`` to ``all_tlobjects.LAYER`` (since it's a constant). - The message from ``BufferError`` is now more useful. Bug fixes and enhancements (v0.13.3) ==================================== *Published at 2017/09/14* .. bugs-fixed-2: Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ - **Reconnection** used to fail because it tried invoking things from the ``ReadThread``. - Inferring **random ids** for ``ForwardMessagesRequest`` wasn't working. - Downloading media from **CDNs** failed due to having forgotten to remove a single line. - ``TcpClient.close()`` now has a **``threading.Lock``**, so ``NoneType has no close()`` should not happen. - New **workaround** for ``msg seqno too low/high``. Also, both ``Session.id/seq`` are not saved anymore. .. enhancements-3: Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ - **Request will be retried** up to 5 times by default rather than failing on the first attempt. - ``InvalidChecksumError``\\ 's are now **ignored** by the library. - ``TelegramClient.get_entity()`` is now **public**, and uses the ``@lru_cache()`` decorator. - New method to **``.send_voice_note()``**\\ 's. - Methods to send message and media now support a **``reply_to`` parameter**. - ``.send_message()`` now returns the **full message** which was just sent. New way to work with updates (v0.13.2) ====================================== *Published at 2017/09/08* This update brings a new way to work with updates, and it's begging for your **feedback**, or better names or ways to do what you can do now. Please refer to the `wiki/Usage Modes <https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/wiki/Usage-Modes>`__ for an in-depth description on how to work with updates now. Notice that you cannot invoke requests from within handlers anymore, only the ``v.0.13.1`` patch allowed you to do so. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ - Periodic pings are back. - The username regex mentioned on ``UsernameInvalidError`` was invalid, but it has now been fixed. - Sending a message to a phone number was failing because the type used for a request had changed on layer 71. - CDN downloads weren't working properly, and now a few patches have been applied to ensure more reliability, although I couldn't personally test this, so again, report any feedback. Invoke other requests from within update callbacks (v0.13.1) ============================================================ *Published at 2017/09/04* .. warning:: This update brings some big changes to the update system, so please read it if you work with them! A silly \"bug\" which hadn't been spotted has now been fixed. Now you can invoke other requests from within your update callbacks. However **this is not advised**. You should post these updates to some other thread, and let that thread do the job instead. Invoking a request from within a callback will mean that, while this request is being invoked, no other things will be read. Internally, the generated code now resides under a *lot* less files, simply for the sake of avoiding so many unnecessary files. The generated code is not meant to be read by anyone, simply to do its job. Unused attributes have been removed from the ``TLObject`` class too, and ``.sign_up()`` returns the user that just logged in in a similar way to ``.sign_in()`` now. Connection modes (v0.13) ======================== *Published at 2017/09/04* +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 71 | +-----------------------+ The purpose of this release is to denote a big change, now you can connect to Telegram through different `**connection modes** <https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/blob/v0.13/telethon/network/connection.py>`__. Also, a **second thread** will *always* be started when you connect a ``TelegramClient``, despite whether you'll be handling updates or ignoring them, whose sole purpose is to constantly read from the network. The reason for this change is as simple as *\"reading and writing shouldn't be related\"*. Even when you're simply ignoring updates, this way, once you send a request you will only need to read the result for the request. Whatever Telegram sent before has already been read and outside the buffer. .. additions-2: Additions ~~~~~~~~~ - The mentioned different connection modes, and a new thread. - You can modify the ``Session`` attributes through the ``TelegramClient`` constructor (using ``**kwargs``). - ``RPCError``\\ 's now belong to some request you've made, which makes more sense. - ``get_input_*`` now handles `None` (default) parameters more gracefully (it used to crash). .. enhancements-4: Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ - The low-level socket doesn't use a handcrafted timeout anymore, which should benefit by avoiding the arbitrary ``sleep(0.1)`` that there used to be. - ``TelegramClient.sign_in`` will call ``.send_code_request`` if no ``code`` was provided. Deprecation ~~~~~~~~~~~ - ``.sign_up`` does *not* take a ``phone`` argument anymore. Change this or you will be using ``phone`` as ``code``, and it will fail! The definition looks like ``def sign_up(self, code, first_name, last_name='')``. - The old ``JsonSession`` finally replaces the original ``Session`` (which used pickle). If you were overriding any of these, you should only worry about overriding ``Session`` now. Added verification for CDN file (v0.12.2) ========================================= *Published at 2017/08/28* Since the Content Distributed Network (CDN) is not handled by Telegram itself, the owners may tamper these files. Telegram sends their sha256 sum for clients to implement this additional verification step, which now the library has. If any CDN has altered the file you're trying to download, ``CdnFileTamperedError`` will be raised to let you know. Besides this. ``TLObject.stringify()`` was showing bytes as lists (now fixed) and RPC errors are reported by default: In an attempt to help everyone who works with the Telegram API, Telethon will by default report all Remote Procedure Call errors to `PWRTelegram <https://pwrtelegram.xyz/>`__, a public database anyone can query, made by `Daniil <https://github.com/danog>`__. All the information sent is a GET request with the error code, error message and method used. .. note:: If you still would like to opt out, simply set ``client.session.report_errors = False`` to disable this feature. However Daniil would really thank you if you helped him (and everyone) by keeping it on! CDN support (v0.12.1) ===================== *Published at 2017/08/24* The biggest news for this update are that downloading media from CDN's (you'll often encounter this when working with popular channels) now **works**. Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ - The method used to download documents crashed because two lines were swapped. - Determining the right path when downloading any file was very weird, now it's been enhanced. - The ``.sign_in()`` method didn't support integer values for the code! Now it does again. Some important internal changes are that the old way to deal with RSA public keys now uses a different module instead the old strange hand-crafted version. Hope the new, super simple ``README.rst`` encourages people to use Telethon and make it better with either suggestions, or pull request. Pull requests are *super* appreciated, but showing some support by leaving a star also feels nice \u2b50\ufe0f. Newbie friendly update (v0.12) ============================== *Published at 2017/08/22* +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 70 | +-----------------------+ This update is overall an attempt to make Telethon a bit more user friendly, along with some other stability enhancements, although it brings quite a few changes. Breaking changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - The ``TelegramClient`` methods ``.send_photo_file()``, ``.send_document_file()`` and ``.send_media_file()`` are now a **single method** called ``.send_file()``. It's also important to note that the **order** of the parameters has been **swapped**: first to *who* you want to send it, then the file itself. - The same applies to ``.download_msg_media()``, which has been renamed to ``.download_media()``. The method now supports a ``Message`` itself too, rather than only ``Message.media``. The specialized ``.download_photo()``, ``.download_document()`` and ``.download_contact()`` still exist, but are private. Additions ~~~~~~~~~ - Updated to **layer 70**! - Both downloading and uploading now support **stream-like objects**. - A lot **faster initial connection** if ``sympy`` is installed (can be installed through ``pip``). - ``libssl`` will also be used if available on your system (likely on Linux based systems). This speed boost should also apply to uploading and downloading files. - You can use a **phone number** or an **username** for methods like ``.send_message()``, ``.send_file()``, and all the other quick-access methods provided by the ``TelegramClient``. .. bug-fixes-5: Bug fixes ~~~~~~~~~ - Crashing when migrating to a new layer and receiving old updates should not happen now. - ``InputPeerChannel`` is now casted to ``InputChannel`` automtically too. - ``.get_new_msg_id()`` should now be thread-safe. No promises. - Logging out on macOS caused a crash, which should be gone now. - More checks to ensure that the connection is flagged correctly as either connected or not. .. note:: Downloading files from CDN's will **not work** yet (something new that comes with layer 70). -------------- That's it, any new idea or suggestion about how to make the project even more friendly is highly appreciated. .. note:: Did you know that you can pretty print any result Telegram returns (called ``TLObject``\\ 's) by using their ``.stringify()`` function? Great for debugging! get_input_* now works with vectors (v0.11.5) ============================================= *Published at 2017/07/11* Quick fix-up of a bug which hadn't been encountered until now. Auto-cast by using ``get_input_*`` now works. get_input_* everywhere (v0.11.4) ================================= *Published at 2017/07/10* For some reason, Telegram doesn't have enough with the `InputPeer <https://tl.telethon.dev/types/input_peer.html>`__. There also exist `InputChannel <https://tl.telethon.dev/types/input_channel.html>`__ and `InputUser <https://tl.telethon.dev/types/input_user.html>`__! You don't have to worry about those anymore, it's handled internally now. Besides this, every Telegram object now features a new default ``.__str__`` look, and also a `.stringify() method <https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/commit/8fd0d7eadd944ff42e18aaf06228adc7aba794b5>`__ to pretty format them, if you ever need to inspect them. The library now uses `the DEBUG level <https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/commit/1f7ac7118750ed84e2165dce9c6aca2e6ea0c6a4>`__ everywhere, so no more warnings or information messages if you had logging enabled. The ``no_webpage`` parameter from ``.send_message`` `has been renamed <https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon/commit/0119a006585acd1a1a9a8901a21bb2f193142cfe>`__ to ``link_preview`` for clarity, so now it does the opposite (but has a clearer intention). Quick .send_message() fix (v0.11.3) =================================== *Published at 2017/07/05* A very quick follow-up release to fix a tiny bug with ``.send_message()``, no new features. Callable TelegramClient (v0.11.2) ================================= *Published at 2017/07/04* +-----------------------+ | Scheme layer used: 68 | +-----------------------+ There is a new preferred way to **invoke requests**, which you're encouraged to use: .. code:: python # New! result = client(SomeRequest()) # Old. result = client.invoke(SomeRequest()) Existing code will continue working, since the old ``.invoke()`` has not been deprecated. When you ``.create_new_connection()``, it will also handle ``FileMigrateError``\\ 's for you, so you don't need to worry about those anymore. .. bugs-fixed-3: Bugs fixes Fixed some errors when installing Telethon via pip (for those using either source distributions or a Python version \u2264 3.5). ConnectionResetError didn't flag sockets as closed, but now it does. On a more technical side, msg_id \\ 's are now more accurate.","title":"Attempts at more stability (v0.13.5)"},{"location":"misc/changelog/#improvements-to-the-updates-v0111","text":"Published at 2017/06/24 Receiving new updates shouldn't miss any anymore, also, periodic pings are back again so it should work on the long run. On a different order of things, .connect() also features a timeout. Notice that the timeout= is not passed as a parameter anymore, and is instead specified when creating the TelegramClient . Bug fixes - Fixed some name class when a request had a ``.msg_id`` parameter. - The correct amount of random bytes is now used in DH request - Fixed ``CONNECTION_APP_VERSION_EMPTY`` when using temporary sessions. - Avoid connecting if already connected. Support for parallel connections (v0.11) ======================================== *Published at 2017/06/16* *This update brings a lot of changes, so it would be nice if you could* **read the whole change log**! Breaking changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - Every Telegram error has now its **own class**, so it's easier to fine-tune your ``except``\\ 's. - Markdown parsing is **not part** of Telethon itself anymore, although there are plans to support it again through a some external module. - The ``.list_sessions()`` has been moved to the ``Session`` class instead. - The ``InteractiveTelegramClient`` is **not** shipped with ``pip`` anymore. Additions A new, more lightweight class has been added. The TelegramBareClient is now the base of the normal TelegramClient , and has the most basic features. New method to .create_new_connection() , which can be ran in parallel with the original connection. This will return the previously mentioned TelegramBareClient already connected. Any file object can now be used to download a file (for instance, a BytesIO() instead a file name). Vales like random_id are now automatically inferred , so you can save yourself from the hassle of writing generate_random_long() everywhere. Same applies to .get_input_peer() , unless you really need the extra performance provided by skipping one if if called manually. Every type now features a new .to_dict() method. .. bug-fixes-6: Bug fixes - Received errors are acknowledged to the server, so they don't happen over and over. - Downloading media on different data centers is now up to **x2 faster**, since there used to be an ``InvalidDCError`` for each file part tried to be downloaded. - Lost messages are now properly skipped. - New way to handle the **result of requests**. The old ``ValueError`` \"*The previously sent request must be resent. However, no request was previously sent (possibly called from a different thread).*\" *should* not happen anymore. Internal changes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ - Some fixes to the ``JsonSession``. - Fixed possibly crashes if trying to ``.invoke()`` a ``Request`` while ``.reconnect()`` was being called on the ``UpdatesThread``. - Some improvements on the ``TcpClient``, such as not switching between blocking and non-blocking sockets. - The code now uses ASCII characters only. - Some enhancements to ``.find_user_or_chat()`` and ``.get_input_peer()``. JSON session file (v0.10.1) =========================== *Published at 2017/06/07* This version is primarily for people to **migrate** their ``.session`` files, which are *pickled*, to the new *JSON* format. Although slightly slower, and a bit more vulnerable since it's plain text, it's a lot more resistant to upgrades. .. warning:: You **must** upgrade to this version before any higher one if you've used Telethon \u2264 v0.10. If you happen to upgrade to an higher version, that's okay, but you will have to manually delete the ``*.session`` file, and logout from that session from an official client. Additions New .get_me() function to get the current user. .is_user_authorized() is now more reliable. New nice button to copy the from telethon.tl.xxx.yyy import Yyy on the online documentation. More error codes added to the errors file. Enhancements - Everything on the documentation is now, theoretically, **sorted alphabetically**. - No second thread is spawned unless one or more update handlers are added. Full support for different DCs and ++stable (v0.10) =================================================== *Published at 2017/06/03* Working with **different data centers** finally *works*! On a different order of things, **reconnection** is now performed automatically every time Telegram decides to kick us off their servers, so now Telethon can really run **forever and ever**! In theory. Enhancements Documentation improvements, such as showing the return type. The msg_id too low/high error should happen less often , if any. Sleeping on the main thread is not done anymore . You will have to except FloodWaitError \\ 's. You can now specify your own application version , device model, system version and language code. Code is now more pythonic (such as making some members private), and other internal improvements (which affect the updates thread ), such as using logger instead a bare print() too. This brings Telethon a whole step closer to v1.0 , though more things should preferably be changed.","title":"Improvements to the updates (v0.11.1)"},{"location":"misc/changelog/#stability-improvements-v091","text":"Published at 2017/05/23 Telethon used to crash a lot when logging in for the very first time.

Enhancements ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Updates thread is only started after a successful login. Files meant to be ran by the user now use shebangs and proper permissions. In-code documentation now shows the returning type. Relative import is now used everywhere, so you can rename telethon to anything else.

When you access [ Message.buttons ][telethon.tl.custom.message.Message.buttons] they are actually [ MessageButton ][telethon.tl.custom.messagebutton.MessageButton], so you might want to refer to that class instead. Helper class to allow defining reply_markup when sending a message with inline or keyboard buttons. You should make use of the defined class methods to create button instances instead making them yourself (i.e. don't do Button(...) but instead use methods line Button.inline(...) <inline> etc. You can use inline , switch_inline and url together to create inline buttons (under the message). You can use text , request_location and request_phone together to create a reply markup (replaces the user keyboard). You can also configure the aspect of the reply with these. You cannot mix the two type of buttons together, and it will error if you try to do so. The text for all buttons may be at most 142 characters. If more characters are given, Telegram will cut the text to 128 characters and add the ellipsis (\u2026) character as the 129. auth ( text , url = None , * , bot = None , write_access = False , fwd_text = None ) staticmethod \u00b6 Creates a new inline button to authorize the user at the given URL.

For more information about letting the user login via Telegram to a certain domain, see https://core.telegram.org/widgets/login . If no url is specified, it will default to text . Parameters: Name Type Description Default bot hints.EntityLike The bot that requires this authorization. By default, this is the bot that is currently logged in (itself), although you may pass a different input peer. Note For now, you cannot use ID or username for this argument.

This will only be present if you use the friendly methods , it won't be there if you invoke raw API methods manually, in which case you should only access members, not properties. contact property readonly \u00b6 The :tl: MessageMediaContact in this message, if it's a contact. dice property readonly \u00b6 The :tl: MessageMediaDice in this message, if it's a dice roll. document property readonly \u00b6 The :tl: Document media in this message, if any. file property readonly \u00b6 Returns a File <telethon.tl.custom.file.File> wrapping the photo or document in this message. If the media type is different (polls, games, none, etc.), this property will be None . This instance lets you easily access other properties, such as file.id <telethon.tl.custom.file.File.id> , file.name <telethon.tl.custom.file.File.name> , etc., without having to manually inspect the document.attributes . forward property readonly \u00b6 The Forward <telethon.tl.custom.forward.Forward> information if this message is a forwarded message. game property readonly \u00b6 The :tl: Game media in this message, if it's a game. geo property readonly \u00b6 The :tl: GeoPoint media in this message, if it has a location. gif property readonly \u00b6 The :tl: Document media in this message, if it's a \"gif\". \"Gif\" files by Telegram are normally .mp4 video files without sound, the so called \"animated\" media. However, it may be the actual gif format if the file is too large. invoice property readonly \u00b6 The :tl: MessageMediaInvoice in this message, if it's an invoice. is_reply property readonly \u00b6 True if the message is a reply to some other message. Remember that you can access the ID of the message this one is replying to through reply_to_msg_id , and the Message object with get_reply_message() . photo property readonly \u00b6 The :tl: Photo media in this message, if any. This will also return the photo for :tl: MessageService if its action is :tl: MessageActionChatEditPhoto , or if the message has a web preview with a photo. poll property readonly \u00b6 The :tl: MessageMediaPoll in this message, if it's a poll. raw_text property writable \u00b6 The raw message text, ignoring any formatting. Will be None for :tl: MessageService . Setting a value to this field will erase the entities , unlike changing the message member. sticker property readonly \u00b6 The :tl: Document media in this message, if it's a sticker. text property writable \u00b6 The message text, formatted using the client's default parse mode. Will be None for :tl: MessageService . venue property readonly \u00b6 The :tl: MessageMediaVenue in this message, if it's a venue. via_bot property readonly \u00b6 The bot :tl: User if the message was sent via said bot.

Does nothing if the message has no buttons. Parameters: Name Type Description Default i int Clicks the i'th button (starting from the index 0). Will raise IndexError if out of bounds. Example: message = ... # get the message somehow # Clicking the 3rd button # [button1] [button2] # [ button3 ] # [button4] [button5] await message . click ( 2 ) # index None j int Clicks the button at position (i, j), these being the indices for the (row, column) respectively. Example: # Clicking the 2nd button on the 1st row. # [button1] [button2] # [ button3 ] # [button4] [button5] await message . click ( 0 , 1 ) # (row, column) This is equivalent to message.buttons[0][1].click() . None text str | callable Clicks the first button with the text \"text\". This may also be a callable, like a re.compile(...).match , and the text will be passed to it. None filter callable Clicks the first button for which the callable returns True . The callable should accept a single MessageButton <telethon.tl.custom.messagebutton.MessageButton> argument. None data bytes This argument overrides the rest and will not search any buttons. Instead, it will directly send the request to behave as if it clicked a button with said data. Note that if the message does not have this data, it will raise DataInvalidError . None Example # Click the first button await message . click ( 0 ) # Click some row/column await message . click ( row , column ) # Click by text await message . click ( text = ':thumbsup:' ) # Click by data await message . click ( data = b 'payload' ) Source code in telethon\\tl\\custom\\message.py 766 767 768 769 770 771 772 773 774 775 776 777 778 779 780 781 782 783 784 785 786 787 788 789 790 791 792 793 794 795 796 797 798 799 800 801 802 803 804 805 806 807 808 809 810 811 812 813 814 815 816 817 818 819 820 821 822 823 824 825 826 827 828 829 830 831 832 833 834 835 836 837 838 839 840 841 842 843 844 845 846 847 848 849 850 851 852 853 854 855 856 857 858 859 860 861 862 863 864 865 866 867 868 869 870 871 872 873 874 875 876 877 878 879 880 881 async def click ( self , i = None , j = None , * , text = None , filter = None , data = None ): \"\"\" Calls `button.click <telethon.tl.custom.messagebutton.MessageButton.click>` on the specified button.

Code without errors doesn't work \u00b6 Then it probably has errors, but you haven't enabled logging yet. To enable logging, at the following code to the top of your main file: import logging logging . basicConfig ( format = '[ %(levelname) 5s / %(asctime)s ] %(name)s : %(message)s ' , level = logging . WARNING ) You can change the logging level to be something different, from less to more information: level = logging . CRITICAL # won't show errors (same as disabled) level = logging . ERROR # will only show errors that you didn't handle level = logging . WARNING # will also show messages with medium severity, such as internal Telegram issues level = logging . INFO # will also show informational messages, such as connection or disconnections level = logging . DEBUG # will show a lot of output to help debugging issues in the library See the official Python documentation for more information on logging_. How can I except FloodWaitError? \u00b6 You can use all errors from the API by importing: from telethon import errors And except them as such: try : await client . send_message ( chat , 'Hi' ) except errors . FloodWaitError as e : # e.seconds is how many seconds you have # to wait before making the request again. print ( 'Flood for' , e . seconds ) My account was deleted/limited when using the library \u00b6 The library will only do things that you tell it to do. If you use the library with bad intentions, Telegram will hopefully ban you. However, you may also be part of a limited country, such as Iran or Russia. In that case, we have bad news for you. Telegram is much more likely to ban these numbers, as they are often used to spam other accounts, likely through the use of libraries like this one. The best advice we can give you is to not abuse the API, like calling many requests really quickly, and to sign up with these phones through an official application. We have also had reports from Kazakhstan and China, where connecting would fail. To solve these connection problems, you should use a proxy. Telegram may also ban virtual (VoIP) phone numbers, as again, they're likely to be used for spam. If you want to check if your account has been limited, simply send a private message to @SpamBot through Telegram itself. You should notice this by getting errors like PeerFloodError , which means you're limited, for instance, when sending a message to some accounts but not others. For more discussion, please see issue #297 . How can I use a proxy? \u00b6 This was one of the first things described in :ref: signing-in . How do I access a field? \u00b6 This is basic Python knowledge. You should use the dot operator: me = await client . get_me () print ( me . username ) # ^ we used the dot operator to access the username attribute result = await client ( functions . photos . GetUserPhotosRequest ( user_id = 'me' , offset = 0 , max_id = 0 , limit = 100 )) # Working with list is also pretty basic print ( result . photos [ 0 ] . sizes [ - 1 ] . type ) # ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ # | | | | \\ type # | | | \\ last size # | | \\ list of sizes # access | \\ first photo from the list # the... \\ list of photos # # To print all, you could do (or mix-and-match): for photo in result . photos : for size in photo . sizes : print ( size . type ) AttributeError: 'coroutine' object has no attribute 'id' \u00b6 You either forgot to: import telethon.sync # ^^^^^ import sync Or: async def handler ( event ): me = await client . get_me () # ^^^^^ note the await print ( me . username ) sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked \u00b6 An older process is still running and is using the same 'session' file. This error occurs when two or more clients use the same session , that is, when you write the same session name to be used in the client: You have an older process using the same session file. You have two different scripts running (interactive sessions count too). You have two clients in the same script running at the same time. The solution is, if you need two clients, use two sessions. If the problem persists and you're on Linux, you can use fuser my.session to find out the process locking the file. As a last resort, you can reboot your system. If you really dislike SQLite, use a different session storage. There is an entire section covering that at :ref: sessions . event.chat or event.sender is None \u00b6 Telegram doesn't always send this information in order to save bandwidth. If you need the information, you should fetch it yourself, since the library won't do unnecessary work unless you need to: async def handler ( event ): chat = await event . get_chat () sender = await event . get_sender () What does bases ChatGetter mean? \u00b6 In Python, classes can base others. This is called inheritance <https://ddg.gg/python%20inheritance> _. What it means is that \"if a class bases another, you can use the other's methods too\". For example, Message <telethon.tl.custom.message.Message> bases ChatGetter <telethon.tl.custom.chatgetter.ChatGetter> . In turn, ChatGetter <telethon.tl.custom.chatgetter.ChatGetter> defines things like obj.chat_id <telethon.tl.custom.chatgetter.ChatGetter> . So if you have a message, you can access that too: # ChatGetter has a chat_id property, and Message bases ChatGetter. # Thus you can use ChatGetter properties and methods from Message print ( message . chat_id ) Telegram has a lot to offer, and inheritance helps the library reduce boilerplate, so it's important to know this concept. For newcomers, this may be a problem, so we explain what it means here in the FAQ. Can I use Flask with the library? \u00b6 Yes, if you know what you are doing. However, you will probably have a lot of headaches to get threads and asyncio to work together. Instead, consider using Quart , an asyncio-based alternative to Flask . Check out quart_login.py for an example web-application based on Quart. Can I use Anaconda/Spyder/IPython with the library? \u00b6 Yes, but these interpreters run the asyncio event loop implicitly, which interferes with the telethon.sync magic module. If you use them, you should not import sync : # Change any of these...: from telethon import TelegramClient , sync , ... from telethon.sync import TelegramClient , ... # ...with this: from telethon import TelegramClient , ... You are also more likely to get \"sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked\" with them. If they cause too much trouble, just write your code in a .py file and run that, or use the normal python interpreter.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"quick-references/faq/#faq","text":"Let's start the quick references section with some useful tips to keep in mind, with the hope that you will understand why certain things work the way that they do.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"quick-references/faq/#code-without-errors-doesnt-work","text":"Then it probably has errors, but you haven't enabled logging yet.
